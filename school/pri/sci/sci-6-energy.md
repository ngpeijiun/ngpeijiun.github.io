# Energy

*February 6, 2023*

## Light (E1)

1. **Light** is a form of **energy**.

2. Objects that give off light are known as **sources of light**. The Sun is our main source of light during the day. Other sources of light include stars, fire, torches, and lamps.

3. We can see objects that are sources of light because they give off light. In the present of light, we are also able to see objects that are not sources of light, because light shines on the objects and is **reflected** into our eyes.

4. Different types of material allow different amounts of light to pass through them

    - Light can pass through <br> Materials such as glass allow most light to pass through them.
    - Light is partially blocked <br> Materials such a frosted glass allow some light to pass through them.
    - Light is completely blocked <br> Materials such as ceramics allow no light to pass through them.

5. Light travels in straight lines. A **shadow** is formed when light is partially or completely blocked by an object.

    - Shape <br> The shadow of an object usually has the same shape as the object. An object can form shadows of different shapes if the light source is shining from different directions of the object.
    - Size <br> The size of a shadow changes if the distance between the object and light source changes, and if the distance between the object and screen changes.

## Heat (E2)

1. **Heat** is a form of **energy**.

2. Objects that give off heat are known as **sources of heat**. The Sun is our main source of heat. It gives living things on the Earth warmth. Other sources of heat include burning gas, burning wood, electrical appliances.

3. **Temperature** is a measure of how hot something is. It is measured in **degree Celsius (Â°C)**. We can measured temperature by using a **thermometer**.

4. More heat is needed to warm up a greater amount of water.

5. Heat always travels from a hotter place to a cooler place until both places reach the same temperature. When the cooler place **gain heat**, they become hotter; when the hotter place **lose heat** they become cooler.

6. Gaining heat causes

    - Temperature to increase
    - Matter in solid state changes to liquid state
    - Matter in liquid state changes to gaseous state
    - Matter to **expand**

7. Losing heat causes

    - Temperature to decrease
    - Matter in gaseous state changes to liquid state
    - Matter in liquid state changes to solid state
    - Matter to **contract**

8. Heat conduction

    - Good conductors of heat <br> Allow heat to easily flow through them. Metals are good conductors of heat.
    - Poor conductors of heat <br> Do not allow heat to easily flow through them. Air, plastics, wood, and rubber are poor conductor of heat.

## Food (E3)

1. **Food** gives all living things energy that they need to carry out life processes.

2. All living things obtain energy from food through a process called **respiration**.

    $$
    \ce{ sugar + oxygen ->[][respiration] energy + water + carbon dioxide }
    $$

3. Plants make food using **light energy**, **carbon dioxide** and **water**, in the process called **photosynthesis**.

    $$
    \ce{ light energy + water + carbon dioxide ->[][photosynthesis] sugar + oxygen }
    $$

4. Plants obtain light energy using a green substance called **chlorophyll** found in the **chloroplasts** of plant cells. Chlorophyll traps light to enable plants to make food.

5. Extra sugar is changed into starch and stored in different parts of plants.

6. Unliked plants, animals cannot make their own food. Animals obtain energy by eating other living things such as plants and animals.

7. Food of all living things is derived in some ways from the Sun.

## Forms of Energy (E4)

1. Light energy <br> Light is a form of energy that enables us to see.

2. Heat energy <br> Heat is a form of energy that makes things warm or hot.

3. Sound energy <br> Sound is a form of energy that we can hear.

4. Electrical energy <br> Electrical energy is a form of energy that is usually generated in power stations. Energy stored in batteries and solar cells can also be changed to electrical energy. Electrical energy can be changed to other forms of energy such as light, head and sound.

5. Kinetic energy <br> Kinetic energy is the energy that a moving object has.

6. Potential energy <br> Potential energy is the energy that is stored in objects.

    - Chemical potential energy <br> Chemical potential energy is stored in food, fuels and batteries.
    - Gravitational potential energy <br> Gravitational potential energy is stored in objects placed above the ground.
    - Elastic potential energy <br> Elastic potential energy is stored when we stretch a rubber band, wind up a toy, compress a spring, and so on.

7. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but they can exist in many forms. The changes of forms of energy is called **energy conversion**.

## Sources of Energy (E5)

1. The Sun <br> The Sun is our primary source of light and heat. Energy from the Sun is called **solar energy**. This **source of energy** will not run out.

    $$
    \ce{ light energy (the Sun) ->[solar cells][solar panels] electrical energy }
    $$

2. Wind <br> Wind is also a source of energy. Windmills and wind turbines use the kinetic energy of wind. The energy of wind will not run out.

    - Windmills

    $$
    \ce{ kinetic energy (wind) -> kinetic energy (blades) -> kinetic energy (gears) }
    $$

    - Wind turbines

    $$
    \ce{ kinetic energy (wind) -> kinetic energy (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator) }
    $$

3. Running water <br> Running water in rivers, streams and waterfalls is another source of energy. Like wind, the energy of running water will not run out.

    - Hydroelectric power station

    $$
    \ce{ gravitational potential energy (water) -> kinetic energy (water) }
    \\
    \ce{ kinetic energy (water) -> kinetic energy (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator) }
    $$

    - Wave power station

    $$
    \ce{ kinetic energy (wave) -> kinetic energy (air) }
    \\
    \ce{ kinetic energy (air) -> kinetic energy (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator) }
    $$

4. Geothermal energy

    - Geothermal power station

    $$
    \ce{ heat energy (geothermal) -> kinetic energy (steam) }
    \\
    \ce{ kinetic energy (steam) -> kinetic energy (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator)}
    $$

5. Fuels <br> Fuels are also sources of energy on the Earth. Coal, oil and natural gas are examples of fuels.

    - Power station

    $$
    \ce{ chemical potential energy -> heat energy + light energy }
    \\
    \ce{ heat energy -> kinetic energy (steam) }
    \\
    \ce{ kinetic energy (steam) -> kinetic energy (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator)}
    $$

6. The Sun is our main source of energy

    - All living things get their energy from food, and all food is derived in some ways from the Sun.
    - Water cycle starts when the water on the earth is heated by the Sun, therefore the energy of running water in the rivers can be tapped.
    - Heating of air causes wind, this allows wind energy and wave energy to be tapped.
    - Fossil fuels are the remains of plants and animals. The energy in fuels can be traced back to the Sun.

7. To meet the world's growing demand for energy, we need alternative sources of energy. Besides coming up with new ways to tap and use these energy sources, we also need to **conserve energy**.

# Cycles

*March 4, 2023*

## Cycles

1. A pattern that repeats itself continuously is called a **cycle**. A cycle helps us to predict changes.

2. All living things go through a cycle called **life cycle**.

3. Living things **reproduce** to ensure **continuity** of their kind. Parents pass on their **characteristics** to their young when they reproduce.

## Life Cycles of Flowering Plants (C1)

1. Life cycle of flowering plants (three stages):

    - Seed
        - Root grows first, shoot grows after some time.
    - Young Plant
        - Has few leaves to start making food.
    - Adult Plant
        - Has more leaves to make food.
        - Has more roots to take in water and minerals from the soil.
        - Flowers appear on adult plant and develop into fruits filled with seeds.

## Reproduction of Flowering Plants (C2)

1. Male reproductive parts

    - **Anther** contains **pollen grains**. Each pollen grain can produce **two male reproductive cells**.
    - **Filament** supports the anther.

2. Female reproductive parts

    - The **style** connects the **stigma** to the **ovary** which contains **ovules**. Each ovule contains **one egg cell**.

### Pollination (C2.1)

1. **Pollination** is the process where pollen grains are transferred from anthers to a stigma, either

    - within the same flower,
    - across flowers of the same plant,
    - or across flowers from different plants of the same kind

2. Insects, birds or wind helps to carry pollen grains to the stigmas of flowers.

    - Flowers pollinated by insects and birds usually have large and brightly coloured petals, and a pleasant scent. Large petals allow bigger insects and birds to land on the flowers. Insects and birds are attracted to the colour and scent of the flowers.

    - Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small and dull coloured.

### Fertilisation (C2.2)

1. The fusion of the male reproductive cell with the egg cell is called **fertilisation**.

    - When the pollen grains land on the surface of stigma, each pollen grain produces a pollen tube.
    - The pollen tube grows down from the stigma, through the style into the ovary.
    - When the pollen tube reaches an ovule, the male reproductive cell from the pollen tube fuses with the egg cell.

2. After fertilisation

    - Flower petals start to wither.
    - The ovary enlarges and forms a fruit. The ovules start to develop into **seeds**.
    - The seeds continue to develop inside the fruit and the fruit grows bigger.

3. Some flowers have only one ovule in the ovary, so the fruits will have only one seed, such as mangoes and cherries; while some flowers have many ovules in the ovary, and the fruits will have many seeds, such as tomatoes and papayas.

4. Fruits protect the seeds until they are ready to be released. When this happens, we say that the fruits are ripe.

### Dispersal (C2.3)

1. **Dispersal** is the process in which fruits or seeds of the plants are scattered as far as possible.

2. Dispersal prevents overcrowding and reduces competition of young plants among themselves and with the parent plant. Plants that grow too closely together have to compete for sunlight, water and minerals.

3. Animal dispersal

    - Seeds in fleshy fruits are dispersed when animals eat the fruits and throw away the seeds, or when the seeds are also eaten and passed out in the droppings.
    - Some seeds have hooks and are dispersed by sticking to the fur of animals or human clothing.

4. Water dispersal

    - Plants that grow in or near water disperse their fruits or seeds by releasing them into the water.

5. Wind dispersal

    - Fruits or seeds dispersed by wind are usually light and small. Some fruits and seeds have wing-like structures that help them stay longer in the air.

6. Splitting / explosive action

    - Fruits or seeds dispersed by splitting usually have pod-like structures which will split open when they are ripe or when they are dried up to shoot their seeds out in different directions.

### Germination (C2.4)

1. Seeds develop into young plants if the conditions are suitable. This process is called **germination**.

2. A seed needs air, water and a suitable temperature to germinate. (light is not needed.)

3. The root grows first, and the baby plant obtains its nutrients from the food stored in the **seed leaves**.

4. The shoot grows after some time and pushes the seed leaves above the soil. Sometimes, the seed leaves still retain their dried-up seed coat on their tips. When the food reserves are used up, the seed leaves may turn green and begin photosynthesis.

5. Then, a bud will appear between the seed leaves, grows into true leaves, and take over food production from seed leaves.

## Reproduction of Non-Flowering Plants (C3)

1. Non-flowering plants such as ferns produce **spores** which is microscopic and contained in spore bags found underside of a leaf. Spores are dispersed by wind and they grow into new plants.

2. Reproduction involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells in flowering plant is called **sexual reproduction**. Reproduction in non-flowering plant only by a single parent is called **asexual reproduction**.

## Life Cycles of Some Animals (C4)

1. Life cycle of mammals (three stages):

    - Egg Cell
    - Young
        - A young mammal looks like adult.
    - Adult

2. Life cycle of birds (e.g. chicken), reptiles, amphibians (e.g. frogs), fish (three stages):

    - Egg
        - Chicken's eggs are laid on land and each egg has a hard shell.
        - Frog's eggs are laid in water and each egg has a jelly-like covering.
    - Young
        - A chick looks like the adult.
        - A tadpole lives in water. It does not look like the adult. It has a tail and breathes through its gills.
    - Adult
        - An adult frog lives in water and on land. It does not have tail and gills anymore. It breathes through their moist skin in water and through their lungs on land.

3. Life cycle of some insects (e.g. cockroaches, grasshoppers) (three stages):

    - Egg
        - Cockcroaches' eggs are laid in an egg case.
        - Grasshoppers' eggs are laid in the soil.
    - Nymph
        - A nymph looks like the adult, except that it is smaller and does not have wings. It **moults** several times as it grows.
    - Adult
        - An adult has wings and it can fly.

4. Life cycle of some insects (e.g. butterflies, mosquitoes, beetles) (four stages):

    - Egg
        - Butterflies' eggs are laid on plants and protected by hard shell.
        - Mosquitoes' eggs are laid on still water.
        - Beetles' eggs are load on leaves.
    - Larva
        - The larva of a butterfly is called a caterpillar. It lives on plants.
        - The larva of a mosquito is called a wriggler. It lives in water.
        - The larva of a ladybird beetle lives on plants.
        - Larva eats a lot and **moults** several times as it grows.
    - Pupa
        - A caterpillar changes into a pupa and attaches itself to a leaf or twig.
        - A wriggler changes into a pupa and lives near the water surface.
        - A ladybird beetle larva changes into a pupa and attaches itself to a leaf and stem of plants.
        - Pupa stops feeding and continues developing in the pupal case.
    - Adult
        - The adult comes out of the pupal case when it breaks open. It spreads its wings and waits for them to dry before flying off.

## Reproduction of Humans (C5)

1. **Ovaries** produce **egg cells** and **testes** produce **sperms**.

2. The fusion of a sperm and an egg cell is called **fertilisation**. The fertilised egg starts to divide and develop in the womb. The baby is born after about nine months.

3. The developing baby obtains nutrients and oxygen from the mother's blood through the umbilical cord. At the same time, waste materials and carbon dioxide are passed from the baby's blood to the mother's blood through the cord.

4. Identical twins develop from the same fertilised egg. The fertilised egg splits into two identical cells which develop into two babies that have exactly the same genetic information.

5. Non-identical twins develop from two different eggs, which are fertilised by two different sperms. The two babies do not have the same genetic information.

## Matter (C6)

1. **Matter** is anything that has **mass** and **volume**.

    - Mass is the amount of **matter** an object has.
    - Volume is the amount of **space** an object occupies.

2. The three **states** of matter are **solid**, **liquid** and **gas**.

    - Water can exist in solid state (ice), liquid state (water) and gaseous state (water vapour).

3. Solid

    - Has a definite shape.
    - Has a definite volume (cannot be compressed).

4. Liquid

    - Has no definite shape.
    - Has a definite volume (cannot be compressed).

5. Gas

    - Has no definite shape.
    - Has no definite volume (can be compressed).

6. Measuring mass

    - Mass can be measured using a balance.
    - Mass is measured in *mg*, *g* and *kg*.

7. Measuring volume

    - The volume of a liquid can be measured accurately using a measuring cylinder or a syringe.
    - Volume is measured in *cm<sup>3</sup>*, *ml* and *l*.

## Water (C7)

1. Three states of water

    - Solid
        - Ice
        - Snow
    - Liquid
        - Water
        - Dew
    - Gas
        - Water vapour
        - Steam

2. Freezing

    - When water **loses heat**, its temperature decreases. When temperature of water decreases to 0°C, any further loss of heat will change water into ice. This process is called **freezing**. The temperature at which water freezes is called the **freezing point** of water.

3. Melting

    - When ice **gains heat**, its temperature increases. When temperature of ice increases to 0°C, any further gain in heat will change ice into water. This process is called **melting**. The temperature at which ice melts is called the **melting point** of ice.

    - Ice melts when it gains heat from the surroundings. The exposed surface gains heat and start to melt first. The greater the exposed surface area, the faster the ice will gain heat and melt.

4. Condensation

    - When air **loses heat**, its temperature decreases. When temperature of the air drops below a temperature called **dew point**, water vapour in the air **loses heat** and condenses to form liquid water known as dew.

    - Hot air can hold more water vapour than cold air.

5. Evaporation

    - When air **gains heat**, its temperature increases. When temperature of the air rises above a temperature called **dew point**, liquid water **gains heat** and evaporate into water vapour.

    - Evaporation and condensation can take place at any temperature. Above dew point, rate of evaporation is faster than rate of condensation. Below dew point, rate of condensation is faster than rate of evaporation.

6. Boiling

    - When water **gains heat**, its temperature increases. When temperature of water increases to 100°C, any further gain in heat will change water into water vapour. This process is called **boiling**. The temperature at which the water boils is called the **boiling point** of water.

    - Water vapour is invisible, but when water reaches boiling point, we usually notice white smoke coming out from the boiling water. When boiled water first enters air, it is still in the form of tiny liquid droplets, and then disappears as it quickly turns into water vapour.

7. Factors affecting rate of condensation and evaporation

    - Air temperature <br> Higher air temperature increases the rate of evaporation and decreases the rate of condensation. This is because hotter air can hold more water vapour than cooler air.
    - Water temperature <br> Higher water temperature increases the rate of evaporation. This is because water molecules are moving faster at higher temperature, it is easier for the molecules to gain enough energy to break away from liquid state to gas state.
    - Wind <br> Faster air movement increases the rate of evaporation and decreases the rate of condensation. When water evaporates, water vapour gathers above the surface of the water. If wind is present, the air holding a lot of water vapour is moving away, and is replaced with air holding less water vapour. This increases the rate of evaporation. Similarly, constant moving of air prevents accumulation of water vapour, and the rate of condensation decreases if the amount of water vapour in the air is lesser.
    - Exposed surface area <br> Larger exposed surface area increases the rate of evaporation. Water evaporates when water molecules gain enough energy to break away from the surface of the water. Larger exposed surface area allows more water molecules to escape simultaneously.

8. Case study

    *Why are there water droplets on the outer surface of a glass of cold water?* <br> When air comes into contact with a cooler surface below dew point, the surrounding air will be cooled and dew (water droplets) will be formed on that surface. The temperature of air further from the cooler surface can remain way above dew point.

    *Why are there water droplets on leaves in early morning?* <br> When sun goes down, air and surfaces heated by sun during the day begin to cool. With morning being the coldest time of the day, temperature on plants and leaves may drop below dew point. When this happens, water vapour condenses to form water droplets on plants and leaves.

    *Why is there fog in early morning? What happen when sun rises?* <br> Air loses heat slower than surfaces. However, on a very cold morning, air temperature can still drop below dew point. When this happens, water vapour in the air (not just those that is near cold surfaces) condenses to dew and fog is formed. The iniating heating of sun will raise the temperature of surfaces faster than air, causing the liquid water on wet surfaces to evaporate at a faster rate. When the water vapour meets with the cold air above, it condenses into dew again, causing the fog to first thicken when sun rises. After a while, the temperature of both air and surfaces rises above dew point, causing the fog to finally clear up.

    *Why is there sometimes fog after rain?* <br> Rain, especially long duration rain, greatly increases water vapour in the air due to evaporation. Fog may not be produced immediately when the rain begins, but the air will gradually have more water vapour enough to produce fog. Cooler air, light wind, and fine rain falling through cloudless sky, contributes to the formation of fog.

    *Why is the cloud white colour?* <br> Clouds appear when there is too much water vapour for the air to hold. The water vapour then condenses to form tiny water droplets (liquid), and it is the water that makes the cloud visible.

## Water Cycle (C8)

1. **Water cycle** is the movement of **water** from earth to the sky and back to earth.

2. Water cycle

    - When **water vapour** rises and reaches the cooler sky, the water vapour **condenses** into water droplets which gather to form **clouds**.
    - When water droplets in the clouds become too big and heavy, they fall onto earth as **rain**. Some of the water falls back into water bodies, while some seeps into the ground.
    - Heat from sun causes water to **evaporates** from water bodies, living things also give up **water vapour**.

3. Water is important for

    - **Humans** in disgestive system, respiratory system, and circulatory system.
    - **Plants** in germination, photosysthesis, and plant transport system.

4. Earth has a large amount of water, but only about 3% is fresh water. More than half of the fresh water is frozen in ice caps and glaciers, and the rest is mostly groundwater. Our main sources of fresh water are rivers, lakes and reservoirs, which make up only about 0.3% of the fresh water.

5. When **water pollution** affects our water sources, we have less clean water to use.

6. We need to **conserve water** so that we do not run out of clean water. Water can be conserved by **reducing** wastage, and by **reusing** and **recycling** water.

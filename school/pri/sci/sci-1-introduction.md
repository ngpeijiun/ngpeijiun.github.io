*March 7, 2023*

## Themes

### Diversity

1. There is a great variety of living and non-living things in the world. Man seeks to organise this great variety of living and non-living things to better understand the world in which he lives.

2. Key Inquiry Questions

    - What can we find around us?
    - How can we classify the great variety of living and non-living things?
    - Why is it important to maintain diversity?

3. Essential Takeaways

    - There is a great variety of living and non-living things around us.
    - Man can classify living and non-living things based on their similarities and differences to better understand them.
    - Maintaining the diversity of living things around us ensures their continual survival.

### Cycles

1. There are repeated patterns of change in nature. Examples of these cycles are the life cycles of living things and the water cycle. Understanding these cycles helps Man to predict events and processes, and to appreciate Earth as a self-sustaining system.

2. Key Inquiry Questions

    - What makes a cycle?
    - Why are cycles important to life?

3. Essential Takeaways

    - A cycle is a repeated pattern of change.
    - Observing cycles helps us to make predictions and understand things around us.


### Systems

1. A system is a whole consisting of parts that work together to perform a function(s). There are systems in nature as well as man-made systems. Examples of systems in nature are the digestive and respiratory systems. Examples of man-made systems are electrical systems. Understanding these systems allows Man to understand how they operate and how parts influence and interact with one another to perform a function.

2. Key Inquiry Questions

    - What is a system?
    - How do parts/systems interact to perform function(s)?

3. Essential Takeaways

    - A system is made of different parts. Each part has its own unique function.
    - Different parts/systems interact to perform function(s).

### Interactions

1. Interactions occur within an organism, between organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. The interactions of Man with the environment drives the development of Science and Technology. At the same time, Science and Technology influences the way Man interacts with the environment. By understanding the interactions between Man and the environment, students can better appreciate the consequences of their actions and be responsible for their actions.

2. Key Inquiry Questions

    - How does Man better understand the environment?
    - What are the consequences of Man's interactions with the environment?

3. Essential Takeaways

    - There are interactions among Man, living and non-living things in the environment.
    - Man can interact with the environment and make positive or negative impacts. Man plays an important role in conservation to ensure continuity of life and availability of resources.

### Energy

1. Energy makes changes and movement possible in everyday life. Man uses various forms of energy for many different purposes. Man is not the only living thing that needs energy; all living things obtain energy and use it to carry out life processes. Understanding this theme will allow students to appreciate the importance and uses of energy and the need to conserve it.

2. Key Inquiry Questions

    - Why is energy important?
    - How is energy used in everyday life?
    - Why is it important to conserve energy?

3. Essential Takeaways

    - Energy is required to enable things to work or move.
    - There are different forms of energy and they can be converted from one form to another.
    - Some sources of energy can be depleted and Man plays an important role in energy conservation.

## Skills

1. Collecting and presenting evidence through:

    - **Observing** <br> This is the skill of using our senses to gather information about objects or events. This is also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses.

    - **Using apparatus and equipment** <br> This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks.

2. Reasoning; making meaning of information and evidence through:

    - **Comparing** <br> This is the skill of identifying the similarities and differences between two or more objects, events, processes, concepts.

    - **Classifying** <br> This is the skill of grouping objects or events based on common characteristics.

    - **Analysing** <br> This is the skill of identifying the parts of objects, information or processes, and the patterns and relationships between these parts.

    - **Inferring** <br> This is the skill of interpreting or explaining observations, data or information.

    - **Evaluating** <br> This is the skill of assessing the reasonableness, accuracy and quality of information, processes or ideas. This is also the skill of assessing the quality and practicality of objects.

3. Engaging with an event, phenomenon or problem through:

    - **Formulating hypothesis** <br> This is the skill of making a general explanation for a related set of observations or events. It is an extension of inferring.

    - **Generating possibilities** <br> This is the skill of exploring all the alternatives, possibilities and choices beyond the obvious one or preferred one.

    - **Predicting** <br> This is the skill of assessing the likelihood of an outcome based on prior knowledge of how things usually turn out.

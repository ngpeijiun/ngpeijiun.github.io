# Interactions

*March 7, 2023*

## Interactions

1. There are interactions among Man, living things and non-living things in the environment.

2. Man can interact with the environment and make a positive or negative impact.

3. Man plays an important role in conservation to ensure the continuity of life and availability of resources.

## Magnets (I1)

1. Attract

    - Attract **magnetic materials**, such as iron and steel (some metals).

    - Do not attract **non-magnetic materials**, such as wood, glass, rubber, ceramics, fabrics, plastics, and some metals (e.g. aluminium, copper).

2. North pole and South pole

    - A magnet has two poles -- **North pole** and **South pole**.
    - The pull or push of a magnet is the strongest at its poles.
    - **Unlike poles** of magnet **attract** (pull).
    - **Like poles** of magnet **repel** (push).

3. Magnetic Earth

    - The Earth acts like a giant magnet with its own North and South poles.
    - A **freely suspended** bar magnet comes to **rest pointing in the North-South direction**.
    - The geographic north pole of the Earth is actually a magnetic south pole, whilst the geographic south pole of the Earth is a magnetic north pole.
    - This characteristic of a magnet allows it to be used to make compasses.

4. Use of magnets

    - **Compasses**
    - **Magnetic chess boards**
    - **Doorstoppers**
    - **Refrigerators**

5. A magnetic object can be **magnetised** using the

    - **Stroke method**
    - **Electrical method**

6. Stroke method

    - The magnetic object is **stroked many times** in the **same direction** with the **same pole** of a magnet each time.

7. Electrical method

    - An electrical wire is coiled many times around the magnetic object, with the ends of the wire connected to a battery.

    - A magnet made using **electricity** is called an **electromagnet**.

    - An electromagnet can attract magnetic objects only if it is connected to a source of electricity. When it is removed from the source of electricity, it will no longer be an electromagnet.

8. Use of electromagnet

    - **Scrap icon crane**
    - **Telephone**
    - **Maglev train**
    - **Hospital equipment**

## Forces (I2)

1. A **force** is a **push** or **pull**.

2. Effects of a force
    - Can *move* a **stationary object** (object at rest) or *stop* a **moving object**
    - Can **speed up**, **slow down**, or **change the direction of motion**
    - May **change the shape of an object**

3. Force and direction

    - When a force is applied to an object at rest, the object will have an increase in speed in the direction of the force.
    - The object continues to speed up as long as the force is acting on the object, the speed stops increasing if the force stops acting on the object.
    - When a greater force is applied to an object, the object will have a greater increase in speed in the direction of the force.
    - When two forces are applied in the same direction, they add up.
    - When two forces are applied in opposite directions and are of equal amount, they will cancel each other completely.

4. Different types of forces

    - Gravitational force
    - Magnetic force
    - Frictional force
    - Elastic spring force

5. Gravitational force

    - Gravitational force is the force of **attraction** between **objects**. This force can act on an object from a **distance**.
    - Gravitational force causes all objects on the Earth to move towards it in the *same* **increasing speed**, regardless of the **mass** of the objects.
    - **Weight** is the amount of gravitational force acting on an object. Since gravitational force is the same, we have different weights due to different mass of our bodies.
    - Gravitational force or weight decreases when the distance between the centres of two objects increases or when the mass of the two objects decreases.
    - Gravitational force or weight increases when the distance between the centres of two objects decreases or when the mass of the two objects increases.

6. Magnetic force

    - Magnetic force is the force exerted by **magnets** on each other or on **magnetic materials**. This force can act on an object from a **distance**.
    - Two like poles repel and push each other away. This force is called the **magnetic force of repulsion**.
    - Two unlike poles attract or pull each other together. This force is called the **magnetic force of attraction**. Magnets also attract magnetic materials such as iron and steel.

7. Frictional force

    - **Frictional force** is the force that **opposes motion** when two surfaces are **in contact**.
    - Frictional force can slow down or stop moving objects as it acts in the opposite direction of motion.
    - There is greater frictional force between an object and a rough surface than between the same object and a smooth surface.
    - The amount of frictional force acting on an object does not depend on the surface area in contact.
    - Frictional force can be reduced by applying lubricant (such as oil or grease) and by using rollers or wheels.

8. Elastic spring force

    - A **spring** is an object that is **elastic**. When we pull or push a spring, the spring is stretched or compressed.
    - **Elastic spring force** is the force exerted by a spring when the spring is stretched or compressed. It allows the spring to return to its original length when the applied force is removed.

## Living Together (I3)

1. Different living things are affected differently by the **factors** in an **environment**.

    - Light
    - Temperature
    - Air
    - Water
      - Drought
      - Flood
    - Food
    - Other kinds of living things
        - Both organisms benefit
        - One organism benefits

2. When plants and animals die, they become food for some bacteria and fungi known as *decomposers*. Decomposers get their food by breaking down dead matter and animal waste into simple substances. These simple substances are returned to the *soil* as nutrients to be used by plants again.

3. An **organism** is a living thing.

4. A **population** is a group of organisms of the same kind that live together and reproduce in a particular place.

5. Populations of plants and animals do not live alone. A **community** is all the different populations of organisms that share the same environment.

6. A **habitat** is a place where a community of organisms live together. Habitats provide organisms with **air**, **water**, **food**, **space**, **shelter**, and **protection**.

7. What communities can be fund in different habitats?

    - Seashore community
    - Mangrove swamp community
    - Pond community
    - Field community
    - Garden community
    - Tree community

## Food Chains and Food Webs (I4)

1. Using chlorophyll, plants trap light energy from the Sun to make their own food during photosynthesis. Plants are called **producers**.

2. Humans and other animals cannot make their own food, but they eat plants or other animals, or both. **Plant-eaters**, **animal-eaters** and **plant-and-animal eaters** are all **consumers**.

3. Animals that hunt and kill other animals for food are called **predators**. Animals that are killed and eaten are called **prey**. When predators kill their prey, they help to control the number of prey in the community.

4. When a plant is eaten by an animal which is in turn eaten by another animal, we have a **food chain**. A food chain always begins with a producer. A food chain shows how energy is transferred from one organism to another.

5. In a community, food chains are interconnected or linked together to form a **food web**.

## Adaptations (I5)

1. There is a diversity of organisms living in different habitats. These organisms have **special characteristics** allow them them to **adapt** to their environment and ensure their **survival** in those habitats.

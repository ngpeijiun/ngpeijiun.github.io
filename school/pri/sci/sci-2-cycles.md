# Cycles

*September 12, 2020*

## Cycles

1. A pattern that repeats itself continuously is called a *cycle*. A cycle helps us to predict changes.

## Life Cycles of Some Animals

1. All living things go through a cycle called a *life cycle*.

2. Life cycle of mammals (three stages):

    - Egg cell
    - Young
    - Adult

2. Life cycle of birds (e.g. chicken), reptiles, amphibians (e.g. frogs), fish (three stages):

    - Egg
    - Young
        - A chick looks like the adult.
        - A tadpole lives in water. It does not look like the adult. It has a tail and breathes through its gills.
    - Adult

3. Life cycle of some insects (e.g. cockroaches, grasshoppers) (three stages):

    - Egg
        - Cockcroaches' eggs are laid in an egg case.
        - Grasshoppers' eggs are laid in the soil.
    - Nymph
        - A nymph looks like the adult, except that it is smaller and does not have wings. It *moults* several times as it grows.
    - Adult
        - Adult has wings and it can fly.

4. Life cycle of some insects (e.g. butterflies, mosquitoes, beetles) (four stages):

    - Egg
        - Butterflies' eggs are laid on plants.
        - Mosquitoes' eggs are laid on still water.
        - Beetles' eggs are load on leaves.
    - Larva
        - The larva of a butterfly is called a caterpillar. It lives on plants.
        - The larva of a mosquito is called a wriggler. It lives in water.
        - The larva of a ladybird beetle lives on plants.
        - Larva eats a lot and moults several times as it grows.
    - Pupa
        - A caterpillar changes into a pupa and attaches itself to a leaf or twig.
        - A wriggler changes into a pupa and lives near the water surface.
        - A ladybird beetle larva changes into a pupa and attaches itself to a leaf and stem of plants.
        - Pupa stops feeding and continues developing in the pupal case.
    - Adult
        - The adult comes out of the pupal case when it breaks open. It spreads its wings and waits for them to dry before flying off.

## Life Cycles of Plants

1. Life cycle of plants (three stages):

    - Seed
        - The root grows first, and shoot grows after some time.
    - Young Plant
        - Has few leaves to start making food.
    - Adult Plant
        - Has more leaves to make food.
        - Has more roots to take in water and minerals from the soil.
        - Flowers appear on adult plant and develop into fruits filled with seeds.

## Matter

1. Matter is anything that has *mass* and occupies *space*.

    - Mass is the amount of matter an object has.
    - Volume is the amount of space an object occupies.

2. The three *states* of matter are *solid*, *liquid* and *gas*.

    - Water can exist in solid state (ice), liquid state (water) and gaseous state (water vapour).

3. Solid

    - Has a definite shape.
    - Has a definite volume (cannot be compressed).

4. Liquid

    - Has no definite shape.
    - Has a definite volume (cannot be compressed).

5. Gas

    - Has no definite shape.
    - Has no definite volume (can be compressed).

6. Measuring mass

    - Mass can be measured using a balance.
    - Mass is measured in *mg*, *g* and *kg*.

7. Measuring volume

    - The volume of a liquid can be measured accurately using a measuring cylinder or a syringe.
    - Volume is measured in *cm<sup>3</sup>*, *ml* and *l*.

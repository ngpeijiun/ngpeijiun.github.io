# Systems

*April 4, 2022*

## Systems

1. Systems are made up of **parts**. Each part has its own unique function. Different parts interact and work together as a whole to perform a larger **function**.

## Air

1. Air

    - Nitrogen (makes up about four-fifths of the air)
    - Oxygen (Needed for burning and by living things to stay alive)
    - Carbon dioxide (Needed by plants during photosynthesis)
    - Water vapour and other gases

2. Moving air is called **wind**.

## Plant Parts (S1)

1. Leaves

    - Make **food** for the plant
    - Have openings for the plant to exchange **gases** with the surroundings

2. Stem

    - **Supports** the plant

3. Roots

    - Absorb **water** and **minerals** from the soil
    - **Hold** the plant firmly to the **ground**

## Plant Respiratory System (S2)

1. Like all other living things, plants need oxygen to stay alive. **Respiration** takes place all the time to **take in oxygen** and **give out carbon dioxide** for the release of energy from food.

2. When there is **sunlight**, plants **make food** by **photosynthesis**. The photosynthesis process **takes in carbon dioxide** and **gives out oxygen**. At the same time, plants also use some of the oxygen produced from photosynthesis for respiration, then the excess oxygen is given out to the surroundings.

3. The exchange of gases with the surroundings occurs through the **tiny openings** mainly found on the underside of leaves away from direct sunlight to prevent water inside the plants from evaporating too fast.

## Plant Transport System (S3)

1. **Water-carrying tubes** transport **water** and **mineral** salts from **roots** to **all parts** of the plant.

2. **Food-carrying tubes** transport **food** in the form of **sugar** from the **leaves** to **all parts** of the plant.

## Human Organ Systems (S4)

1. Digestive System

    - Breaks down food into simpler substances which can be absorbed and used by the body

2. Circulatory System

    - Transports digested food, water, oxygen, and waste materials

3. Respiratory System

    - Takes in and removes air from the body

4. Skeletal System

    - Supports the body, gives the body shape and protects the organs

5. Muscular System

    - Helps different body parts to move

## Human Digestive System (S5)

1. Mouth

    - Chews and partially digests food with digestive juices (saliva)

2. Gullet

    - Transfers food from the mouth to the stomach

3. Stomach

    - Produces digestive juices (gastric juice) to digest food

4. Small intestine

    - Completes digestion and absorbs digested food into the body

5. Large intestine

    - Absorbs water from undigested food

6. Anus

    - Passes out undigested food (solid waste) from the body

## Human Respiratory System (S6)

1. Nose

    - Allows air to enter and leave the body

2. Windpipe

    - Transports air to and from the lungs

3. Lungs

    - Allow oxygen to enter the blood and carbon dioxide to leave the blood

4. Air sacs

    - Increase the surface area to allow for gaseous exchange

5. All these parts work together for a process called breathing to take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide.

    - Breath in <br> Oxygen passes through the walls of the air sacs into the blood in blood vessels

    - Breath out <br> Carbon dioxide passes into the air from the blood in blood vessels

6. Fish take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide when water enters their mouth and passes through their gills. Dissolved oxygen enters the blood in the gills, and carbon dioxide is removed from the blood in the gills and dissolved into water.

## Human Circulatory System (S7)

1. Heart

    - Pumps blood all the time to all parts of the body
    - Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to all parts of the body
    - Receives oxygen-poor blood from all parts of the body and pumps it to the lungs

2. Blood vessels

    - Tubes that enable blood to be transported to all parts of the body

3. Blood

    - Transports oxygen from and carbon dioxide back to the lungs for removal
    - Transports water and digested food from intestines to all parts of the body
    - Transports waste materials (and excess water) away from various parts of the body (to kidneys) for removal (through urination)

## Integration of Human Organ Systems (S8)

1. The human circulatory system circulates blood in two loops.

2. In the circulation loop of blood from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart, the circulatory system integrates with respiratory system to take in oxygen to the blood, and give out carbon dioxide from the blood.

3. In the circulation loop of blood from the heart to all parts of the body and back to the heart, the circulatory system integrates with digestive system to take in digested food and water.

## Cell System (S9)

1. A cell is a basic unit of life.

2. Multiple cells work together to form tissue, and multiple tissues work together to form an organ.

3. Cells reproduce through division for growth and to replace old and damaged cells.

4. Animal cells have

    - Nucleus <br> Contains genetic material and controls all acitivities of the cell

    - Cytoplasm <br> Jelly-like substance where most cell activities take place

    - Cell membrane <br> Allow substances to enter and leave the cell

5. Plant cells have

    - Nucleus

    - Cytoplasm

    - Chloroplast <br> Contains chlorophyll, a green pigment, which traps sunlight to make food for the plant

    - Cell membrane

    - Cell wall <br> Is found outside the cell membrane to support and give plant cell its shape

## Electrical System (S10)

1. An electric circuit is an electrical system made up of electrical parts such as battery, wire, switch and bulb.

2. Different electrical parts can be represented by symbols to form a circuit diagram representing an electric circuit.

3. Electrical parts

    - Battery <br> Is an energy source which has positive and negative end

    - Wire <br> Connects all parts of the circuit together

    - Switch <br> Is added to a circuit to control the circuit to be open or closed

    - Bulb <br> When the metal casing and metal tip are connected to the circuit, the electric current flows through the metal filament inside the glass bulb, the filament is heated and glows.

4. In a closed circuit, all parts are properly connected and there are no gaps between the parts. Thus, electric current flows through the circuit.

5. In an open circuit, not all parts are properly connected and there are one or more gaps between the parts. Thus, electric current does not flow through the circuit.

6. Electrical conductors are materials such as iron, steel, and copper that allow electric current to flow through them.

7. Electrical insulators are materials such as wood, plastic, and rubber that do not allow electric current to flow through them.

8. We can test if a material is electrical conductor or insulator by using a circuit tester.

9. Electrical conductors and insulators are used for different parts of a circuit.

    - Wire <br> The copper wires inside a wire are conductors while the rubber covering is insulator to protect us from the electric current.

    - Switch <br> The two steel contacts connecting to copper wires from both ends are conductors, the steel blade that is in either open or closed position is a conductor, and the plastic handle for our hand to toggle the switch is an insulator.

10. The brightness of a bulb depends on the amount of electric current flowing through the bulb in a circuit. When batteries are connected in series, more electric current flows through the bulb. Thus, the brightness of the bulb increases. If too many batteries are connected in series, too much electric current will cause the filament to heat up and melt, and the bulb will blow.

11. When bulbs are connected in series, less amount of electric current flows in the circuit. Thus, the brightness of the bulbs decreases. As the amount of the current flow is lower, the battery will be drained slower.

12. When bulbs are connected in parallel, more amount of electric current flows in the circuit such that the amount of electric current flowing through each branch remains the same. Thus, the brightness of the bulb is the same. As the amount of the current flow is higher, the battery will be drained faster.

13. Electricity needs to be conserved so that fuels can last longer.

14. Electricity needs to be used safely to prevent electric shocks and fires.

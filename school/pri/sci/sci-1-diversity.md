## Diversity

1. Diversity
    - Characteristics
        - Similarities
        - Differences
    - Classification (classify / organise)
        - Tables
        - Diagrams

2. Things
    - Living things
    - Non-living things

3. Living things
    - Groups
        - Plants
        - Animals
        - Fungi
        - Bacteria
    - Characteristics
        - Need air, water and food
        - Grow
        - Respond to changes around them
        - Reproduce

4. Non-living things
    - Materials
        - Wood
        - Glass
        - Rubber
        - Metals
        - Ceramics
        - Fabrics
        - Plastics

## Plants

1. Plants
    - Flowering plants
        - Roots
        - Stems
        - Leaves
        - *Flowers*
        - *Fruits*
    - Non-flowering plants
        - Roots
        - Stems
        - Leaves

## Animals

1. Animals
    - Endothermic
        - Have a constant body temperature that does not change with the surrounding temperature.
    - Ectothermic
        - Do not have a constant body temperature. Their body temperature changes according to the temperature of their surroundings.

2. Insects
    - Their bodies are covered with hard outer covering, and divided into three parts.
    - Have three pairs of legs and a pair of feelers.
    - All insects hatch from eggs.
    - Ectothermic

3. Fish
    - Live in water.
    - Their bodies are covered with scales.
    - Breathe through their gills in water.
    - Have fins to help them swim.
    - Most fish lay eggs.
    - Ectothermic

4. Amphibians
    - Live in water and on land.
    - Breathe through their moist skin in water and through their lungs on land.
    - Most amphibians lay eggs.
    - Their young usually live in water.
    - Ectothermic

5. Reptiles
    - Some live on land and some live in water.
    - Have dry skin that is usually covered with scales.
    - Some have shells.
    - Most reptiles lay eggs.
    - Ectothermic

6. Birds
    - The only animals covered with feathers.
    - Feathers help them to fly and keep them warm.
    - Have a beak, a pair of wings, and a pair of legs.
    - All birds lay eggs.
    - Endothermic

7. Mammals
    - Some live on land and some live in water.
    - Some can fly and some can glide.
    - Have hair on their bodies.
    - Most mammals give birth to their young, a few lay eggs.
    - All mammals produce milk for their young to feed on.
    - Endothermic.

## Fungi

1. Fungi
    - Come in different shapes and sizes.
    - Some can be very small and can be seen only under a microscope. Example:
        - Large sizes: mushrooms
        - Microorganisms: moulds, yeasts
    - Grow in place with a lot of moisture, cannot move from place to place.
    - Feed on living things, dead or alive.
    - Reproduce by spores.
    - Can be useful and harmful to us.

## Bacteria

1. Bacteria
    - Come in different shapes and sizes.
    - Are very small and can be seen only under a microscope.
    - Feed on living things, dead or alive.
    - Reproduce by binary fission.
    - Can be useful or harmful to us.

## Materials

1. Materials
    - Wood (Trees)
    - Glass (Sand)
    - Rubber (White milky liquid that flows out from the trunks of rubber trees)
    - Metals (Ground)
    - Ceramics (Clay)
    - Fabrics (Wool / silk from animals, and cottons from plants)
    - Plastics (Oil)

1. Strength
    - Strong
    - Not strong

2. Flexibility (Ability to change shape)
    - Flexible
    - Stiff

3. Density (Ability to float or sink in water)
    - Float
    - Sink

4. Transparency
    - Allow most light to pass through them
    - Allow some light to pass through them
    - Do not allow light to pass through them

5. Waterproof
    - Absorb water
    - Do not absorb water

## The Scientific Endeavour

### What is Science?

1. Science is the study of natural phenomena in the world.

### Scientific Knowledge

1. Science is evidence-based

    - **Evidence**, obtained through **observation** and **experimentation**, plays an important role in supporting **hypotheses** and **theories**.

    - Observations made using our senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), which are typically expressed in words or drawings to describe an object or phenomenon, are called **qualitative data**.

    - Measurements, which are numerical quantities of an object or phenomenon, are called **quantitative data**.

2. Construction of scientific knowledge

    - When designing a scientific investigation, we need to consider the types of data (qualitative or quantitative) to be collected and the ways to collect it.

    - The data are analysed for patterns and trends to make **inferences** and **conclusions**.

    - These inferences and conclusions may support or reject a scientific idea (hypothesis).

    - A new scientific idea may be proposed in light of new evidence. However, a scientific knowledge (theory) should only be changed when the **scientific community** accepts the new idea after considering and analysing the new evidence thoroughly.

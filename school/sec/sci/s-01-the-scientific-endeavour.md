## The Scientific Endeavour

### What is Science?

1. Science is the study of the natural world.

### Scientific Knowledge

1. Science is evidence-based

    - **Evidence** obtained through **observation** and **experimentation** is used to support **hypotheses** and **theories**.

    - **Qualitative data** are observations of an object or phenomenon made using our senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), expressed in words or drawings.

    - **Quantitative data** are numerical measurements of an object or phenomenon.

2. Construction of scientific knowledge

    - When designing a scientific investigation, we need to consider the types of *data* (qualitative or quantitative) to be collected and how to collect it.

    - The data are analysed for patterns and trends to make **inferences** and **conclusions**.

    - Inferences and conclusions may *support* or *reject* a scientific idea (hypothesis).

    - A new scientific idea may be proposed in light of new evidence, but a scientific knowledge (theory) should only be changed when the **scientific community** accepts the new idea.

### Practices of Science

1. Posing questions and defining problems

    - We ask questions to define and solve problems. The six common question words are *what*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *which*, and *how*.

2. Designing scientific investigations

    - A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation for an observation that can be tested scientifically. It usually accompanies a scientific question.

    - There are three types of variables to consider when planning an experiment:

        - **Variable to be changed** - Only one variable should be changed.
        - **Variables to be observed or measured** - Data to be collected are either qualitative or quantitative.
        - **Variables to be kept constant** - To ensure a fair experiment, all variables that may affect the observations or measurements should be kept constant.

    - Test a hypothesis by repeating an experiment with only one variable changed each time. If the results do not support the hypothesis, it is still valuable to eliminate the proposed explanation and explore new ones.

3. Measurement

    - Readings taken from the measuring instruments and apparatus are expressed as a **numerical value** with a **unit**.

    - **SI units** (the International System of Units) is a standardised system of units used to ensure a common standard when making measurements.

        | Quantity    | SI Unit | Other Common Units    |
        |:-----------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|
        | volume      | $m^3$   | $cm^3,ml$             |
        | mass        | $kg$    | $g$                   |
        | time        | $s$     | $min,h$               |
        | length      | $m$     | $cm,mm$               |
        | temperature | $K$     | $\degree C,\degree F$ |

4. Accuracy, precision and errors

    - The **accuracy** of a measurement is how close a *reading* is to the true value.

    - The **precision** of repeated measurements is how close the *readings* are to one another.

    - **Zero error** refers to a measuring instrument providing a non-zero reading when the measured quantity is actually zero.

    - **Parallax error** occurs when measuring instruments are viewed from an incorrect angle or when the eye is not properly positioned.

5. Developing explanations and solutions

    - Data collected from investigations can be presented in different ways to identify and communicate patterns or trends. Studying these patterns and trends can help to propose explanations for observation and develop solutions to problems.

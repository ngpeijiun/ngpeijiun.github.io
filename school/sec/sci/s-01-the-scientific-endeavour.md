# The Scientific Endeavour

*Jul 1, 2024*

## What is Science?

1.  Science is the study of the natural world.

## Scientific Method

1.  The **scientific method** is a structured approach for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or refining existing knowledge. It involves making observations, forming a hypothesis, conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analysing the results, and drawing conclusions that can be shared and replicated.

2.  Steps of scientific method

    -   Ask a question
    -   Do background research
    -   Construct a hypothesis
    -   Test the hypothesis by doing an experiment
    -   Analyse the data and draw a conclusion
    -   Communicate the results

3.  Make an observation and ask a question

    The scientific method starts when you ask a question about something that you observe: *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how*.

4.  Do background research

    After formulating your question, the next step is to conduct background research. This involves gathering existing information and resources that can help you understand the topic better.

5.  Construct a hypothesis

    After gathering sufficient background information, the next step is to construct this testable statement that provides a potential answer to your research question. A good hypothesis allows you to then make a prediction: "If *I do this*, then *this* will happen."

## Scientific Knowledge

1.  Science is evidence-based

    -   **Evidence** obtained through **observation** and **experimentation** is used to support **hypotheses** and **theories**.
    -   **Qualitative data** are observations of an object or phenomenon made using our senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), expressed in words or drawings.
    -   **Quantitative data** are numerical measurements of an object or phenomenon taken using instruments.

2.  Construction of scientific knowledge

    -   When designing a scientific investigation, we need to consider the types of *data* (qualitative or quantitative) to be collected and the methods of collection.
    -   The data are analysed for patterns and trends to make **inferences** and draw **conclusions**.
    -   Inferences and conclusions may *support* or *reject* a scientific idea (hypothesis).
    -   A new scientific idea may be proposed in light of new evidence, but a scientific knowledge (theory) should only be changed when the **scientific community** accepts the new idea.

## Practices of Science

1.  Posing questions and defining problems

    -   We ask questions to define and solve problems. The six common question words are *what*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *which*, and *how*.

2.  Designing scientific investigations

    -   A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation for a scientific question that can be tested scientifically.

    -   There are three types of variables to consider when planning an experiment:

        -   **Variable to be changed** <br> Only one variable should be changed.
        -   **Variables to be observed or measured** <br> Data to be collected are either qualitative or quantitative.
        -   **Variables to be kept constant** <br> To ensure a fair experiment, all variables that may affect the observations or measurements should be kept constant.

    -   A hypothesis can be tested by repeating an experiment with only one variable changed each time. If the results do not support the hypothesis, the process of testing the hypothesis is still valuable to eliminate the proposed explanation and explore new ones.

    -   A hypothesis may also be proposed based on observations and measurements made during an experiement.

3.  Measurement

    -   Readings taken from the measuring instruments and apparatus are expressed as a **numerical value** with a **unit**.

    -   **SI units** (the International System of Units) is a system of standardised units used to ensure a common standard when making measurements.

        | Quantity    | SI Unit | Other Common Units    |
        |:-----------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|
        | length      | $m$     | $cm,mm$               |
        | volume      | $m^3$   | $cm^3,ml$             |
        | time        | $s$     | $min,h$               |
        | mass        | $kg$    | $g$                   |
        | temperature | $K$     | $\degree C,\degree F$ |

4.  Accuracy, precision and errors

    -   The **accuracy** of a measurement is how close a *reading* is to the true value.
    -   The **precision** of repeated measurements is how close the *readings* are to one another.
    -   An instrument has **zero error** when it gives a *non-zero reading* when the true value should be zero.
    -   **Parallax error** is introduced when the marking on an instrument is viewed from an incorrect angle or when the eye is not properly positioned.
    -   **Systematic error** is consistent and predictable, often caused by a flaw in measurement system, such as a zero error in an instrument. Systematic errors affect the accuracy of measurements but not their precision.
    -   **Random error** arises from unpredictable variations in the measurement process, such as environmental changes or inherent fluctuations in the measuring instrument. Random errors affect the precision of measurements because they cause variations in repeated measurements. However, taking average of multiple measurements can help reduce the impact of random errors, potentially leading to an accurate result.

5.  Developing explanations and solutions

    -   Data collected from investigations can be presented in different ways to identify and communicate patterns or trends. Studying these patterns and trends can help propose explanations for observation and develop solutions to problems.

6.  Evaluating, reasoning and communicating

    -   The different forms of communication allow scientific ideas to be critiqued and defended. This process involves reasoning based on evidence. It provides an avenue for the scientific community to discuss and evaluate explanations and solutions before accepting them.

7.  Values, ethics and attitudes

    -   Our values, ethics and attitudes affect how we apply our scientific knowledge and the types of investigations we carry out, which in turn influence our scientific and societal contributions.
    -   Perserverance, curiosity, open-mindedness, objectivity, creativity, responsibility, integrity are examples of scientific attitudes that scientists should embody in their work.

8.  Safe practices in science

    Hazard symbols are developed by the United Nations as part of standardised communication on chemical hazards.

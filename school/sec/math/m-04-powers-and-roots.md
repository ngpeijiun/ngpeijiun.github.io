## Square Numbers and Square Roots

1.  Square Numbers

    -   Definition: A square number is a number that is the product of an integer multiplied by itself.
    -   Examples:
        -   $1^2=1$
        -   $2^2=4$
        -   $3^2=9$
        -   $4^2=16$, etc.
    -   Properties:
        -   The square of an even number is always even.
        -   The square of an odd number is always odd.
        -   The square of any positive or negative number is always positive.
        -   Square numbers always have an odd number of factors.

2.  Square Roots

    -   Definition: The square root of a number is a value that, when squared, gives the original number.
    -   Notation: The square root $x$ is written as $\sqrt{x}$.
    -   Examples:
        -   $\sqrt{9}=3$
        -   $\sqrt{169}=13$
    -   Properties:
        -   The square root of a perfect square is always a whole number.
        -   Square roots of non-perfect squares are irrational.

## Cube Numbers and Cube Roots

1.  Cube Numbers

    -   Definition: A cube number is a number that is the product of an integer multiplied by itself twice.
    -   Examples:
        -   $1^3=1$
        -   $1^3=1$
        -   $1^3=1$
        -   $1^3=1$, etc.
    -   Properties:
        -   The cube of an even number is always even.
        -   The cube of an odd number is always odd.
        -   The cube of a negative number is always negative.
        -   The last digit of a cube number follows certain patterns based on the last digit of the original number.

2.  Cube Roots

    -   Definition: The cube root of a number is a value that, when cubed, gives the original number.
    -   Notation: The cube root of $x$ is written as $\sqrt[3]{x}$.
    -   Examples:
        -   $\sqrt[3]{8}=2$
        -   $\sqrt[3]{27}=3$
    -   Properties:
        -   Cube roots exist for all real numbers, including negatives.

## Other Powers and Roots

1.  Higher Powers

    -   A number raised to an exponent represents repeated multiplication.
    -   Examples:
        -   $2^4=2\times2\times2\times2=16$
        -   $3^5=3\times3\times3\times3\times3=243$

2.  Fractional Powers

    -   A fractional exponent represents a root:
        -   $x^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{x}$
        -   $x^{\frac{1}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{x}$
    -   Examples:
        -   $4^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{4}=2$
        -   $8^{\frac{2}{3}}=\left(\sqrt[3]{8}\right)^2=2^2=4$

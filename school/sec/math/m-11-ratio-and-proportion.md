# Ratio and Proportion

*Feb 25, 2025*

## Understanding Ratio

1.  Definition

    -   A ratio is a way of comparing two or more quantities of the same kind by division.
    -   Expressed in the form $a:b$ or as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$.

2.  Simplifying Ratios

    -   Divide all terms by their highest common factor (HCF).
    -   Example: $20:30:40$ simplifies to $2:3:4$ (dividing by $10$).

3.  Equivalent Ratios

    -   Multiply or divide all terms by the same non-zero number.
    -   Example: $2:3$ is equivalent to $4:6$ (multiplying both terms by $2$).

## Dividing a Quantity in a Given Ratio

1.  Method

    -   Add the parts of the ratio to get the total.
    -   Divide the total quantity in proportion to each part.
    -   Example:

        Divide $100$ in the ratio $2:3$.

        Total parts $=2+3=5$

        First share $=100\times\frac{2}{5}=40$

        Second share $=100\times\frac{3}{5}=60$

## Proportion

1.  Definition

    -   Proportion states that two ratios are equal.
    -   Written as $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$ or $a:b::c:d$

2.  Direct Proportion

    When one quantity increases, the other also increases proportionally.

    -   Formula: $y=kx$
    -   Example: $3$ apples cost $\$6$, then $6$ apples cost $\$12$.

3.  Inverse Proportion

    When one quantity increases, the other decreases proportionally.

    -   Formula: $xy=k$
    -   Example: If $4$ workers take $10$ hours, $8$ workers take $5$ hours.

# Laws of Artihmetic

*Feb 7, 2022*

## Commutative Law

1. Commutative law states that the order in which two numbers are added or multiplied does not affect the result.

    $$
    a+b=b+a\\
    a\times b=b\times a
    $$

## Associative Law

1. Associative law states that when three numbers are added or multiplied the grouping of the numbers does not affect the result.

    $$
    ( a+b) +c=a+( b+c)\\
    ( a\times b) \times c=a\times ( b\times c)
    $$

## Distributive Law

1. Distributive law says that in a multiplication problem, when one factor is rewritten as the sum of two numbers, the product does not change. The distributive law is sometimes called **the distributive law of multiplication over addition**.

    $$
    a\times ( b+c) =a\times b+a\times c
    $$

## Order of Operations

1. PEMA rule

    | Order | Operations | Variation |
    |:---:|:---|:---|
    | 1 | **P**arenthesis $()$ | |
    | 2 | **E**xponent $(a^x)$ | $(a^{\frac{1}{x}})$ or $\sqrt[x]{a}$ |
    | 3 | **M**ultiplication $(a\times x)$ | Division $(a\times \frac{1}{x})$ or $(a\div x)$ |
    | 4 | **A**ddition $(a+x)$ | Subtraction $(a+(-x))$ or $(a-x)$ |

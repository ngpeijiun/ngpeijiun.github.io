## Units of Time and Conversions

1.  Common Units of Time

    -   $1$ minute $=60$ seconds
    -   $1$ hour $=60$ minutes
    -   $1$ day $=24$ hours
    -   $1$ week $=7$ days
    -   $1$ year $\approx365$ days (or $366$ days in a leap year)
    -   $1$ month $\approx30$ or $31$ days (depending on the month)

## 24-hour and 12-hour Clocks

1.  12-hour Clock System

    -   Time is divided into **a.m.** (midnight to midday) and **p.m.** (midday to midnight).
    -   Examples:
        -   `3:15 a.m.` is `03:15` in the morning.
        -   `3:15 p.m.` is `15:15` in 24-hour format.

2. 24-hour Clock System

    -   Time is shown from `00:00` (midnight) to `23:59`.
    -   No need for `a.m.` or `p.m.` labels.
    -   Examples:
        -   `3:15 a.m.` → `03:15`
        -   `3:15 p.m.` → `15:15`
        -   `12:00 p.m.` → `12:00`
        -   `12:00 a.m.` → `00:00`

3. Conversion between 12-hour and 24-hour Format

    -   For *a.m.* times: No change except midnight (`12:00 a.m.` = `00:00`).
    -   For *p.m.* times: Add $12$ to the hour (except for `12:00 p.m.`).
    -   Examples:
        -   `7:30 a.m.` → `07:30`
        -   `7:30 p.m.` → `19:30`
        -   `12:45 p.m.` → `12:45`
        -   `12:45 a.m.` → `00:45`

## Reading Clocks and Timetables

1. Reading Clocks

    - Analog Clocks: Interpret hour and minute hands.
    - Digital Clocks: Directly read the digits.

2. **Using Timetables**

    - Understand schedules (e.g., bus, train, or flight timetables).
    - Pay attention to arrival and departure times in either 12-hour or 24-hour format.

    **Example**:
    | Train | Departure | Arrival |
    |:-----|:---------|:-------|
    | A    | 08:30     | 10:15  |
    | B    | 11:45     | 13:00  |

    - Travel time for Train A = $10:15-08:30=1$ hour $45$ minutes.

3. **Time Zone Calculations**

    - Adjust time based on different time zones.
    - Example:
        - Singapore Time (SGT) is UTC +8.
        - London Time (GMT) is UTC +0.
        - If it is $10$ a.m. in Singapore, it is $2$ a.m. in London.

4. **Time Differences**

    - Find the difference between two times.
    - If crossing midnight, add $24$ hours for calculation.

    **Example**:
    - From $23:30$ to $01:30$ the next day:
        - $01:30+24:00-23:30=2$ hours.

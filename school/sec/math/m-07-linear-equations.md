# Linear Equations

*Feb 19, 2022*

## Linear Equations

1. A linear equation is an equation with the variable of the highest power raised to one.

2. A linear equation with one variable is expressed in the form of

    $$
    ax+b=0
    $$

    where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $x$ is a variable.

## Linear Equations With Two Variables

1. A linear equation with two variables is expressed in the form of

    $$
    ax+by+c=0
    $$

    where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and $x$ and $y$ are two variables.

2. Two equations are required in order to solve the two unknown variables. These two equations are known as **simultaneous equations**, and they are solved *simultaneously*. Simultaneous equations can be solved by using elimination method or substitution method.

3. Elimination method

    **Worked Example**

    > Solve the following simultaneous equations using elimination method.

    $$
    4x-2y-4 =0\\
    5x+3y-16 =0
    $$

    **Solution**

    $$
    4x-2y-4 =0 \tag{1}
    $$

    $$
    5x+3y-16 =0 \tag{2}
    $$

    $$
    ( 1) \times 3\Longrightarrow 12x-6y-12=0 \tag{3}
    $$

    $$
    ( 2) \times 2\Longrightarrow 10x+6y-32=0 \tag{4}
    $$

    $(3)+(4)$ to eliminate $y$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    22x-44 & =0\\
    22x & =44\\
    x & =2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Substitute $x=2$ into $(1)$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    4( 2) -2y-4 & =0\\
    2y & =4\\
    y & =2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Therefore, $x=2$ and $y=2$.

4. Substitution method

    **Worked Example**

    > Solve the following simutaneous equations using substitution method.

    $$
    4x-2y-4 =0\\
    5x+3y-16 =0
    $$

    **Solution**

    $$
    4x-2y-4 =0 \tag{1}
    $$

    $$
    5x+3y-16 =0 \tag{2}
    $$

    From $(1)$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    4x & =2y+4\\
    x & =\frac{1}{2}y+1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Substitute the value of $x$ into $(2)$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    5\left(\frac{1}{2} y+1\right) +3y-16 & =0\\
    \frac{5}{2} y+5+3y-16 & =0\\
    \frac{11}{2} y & =11\\
    11y & =22\\
    y & =2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Substitute $y=2$ into $(1)$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    4x-2( 2) -4 & =0\\
    4x & =8\\
    x & =2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Therefore, $x=2$ and $y=2$.

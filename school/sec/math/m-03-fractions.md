## Fractions

1. Fractions are written in the form of

    $$
    \frac{a}{b}\text{ where } b\neq 0
    $$

    $a$ is called numerator and $b$ is called denominator.

2. Equivalent fractions

    - Example of equivalent fractions are $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{4}{8}$.

## Types of Fractions

1. Proper fractions

    - A proper fraction is a fraction with a numerator that is smaller than the denominator.
    - Examples of proper fractions are $\frac{1}{6} ,\frac{7}{15} ,\frac{3}{100}$.

2. Improper fractions

    - An improper fraction is a fraction with a numerator that is greater than the denominator.
    - Examples of improper fractions are $\frac{5}{4} ,\frac{19}{15} ,\frac{125}{99}$.

3. Mixed fractions

    - A mixed fraction is a fraction containing a whole number and a proper fraction.
    - Examples of mixed fractions are $2\frac{1}{2} ,5\frac{7}{9} ,\frac{4}{5}$.

4. Like fractions

    - Like fractions are fractions with the same denominator.

## Fraction Arithmetic

1. Addition and subtraction

    - To add or subtract fractions, convert the operands into like fractions.
    - Find the common denominator of the like fractions by finding their **lowest common multiple** (LCM).

2. Multiplication

    $$
    \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} =\frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
    $$

3. Division

    $$
    \frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} =\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c} =\frac{a \times d}{b \times c}
    $$

## Fractions to Decimals

1. If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $b\neq 0$, then

    $$
    \frac{a}{b} =a\div b
    $$

2. An **exact decimal** is one where all its digits can be written down, e.g. $0.2,3.5,14.75$.

3. A **recurring decimal** is one where the digits go on forever but some of the digits are repeating. They are expressed by putting dots above the repeating digits.

    $$
    \frac{a}{b} =x.yyy\dotsc \text{, the recurring notation is written as } x.\dot{y}\\
    \frac{a}{b} =x.yzyzyz\dotsc \text{, the recurring notation is written as } x.\dot{y}\dot{z}
    $$

    For example,

    $$
    \frac{41}{99} =0.4141\cdots =0.\dot{4}\dot{1}
    $$

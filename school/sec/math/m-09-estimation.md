## Rounding to a Specified Degree of Accuracy

1.  Definition

    -   **Rounding** is the process of reducing the number of digits while keeping the value close to the original.
    -   Used to simplify calculations and improve clarity.

2.  Methods of Rounding

    -   **Decimal Places**
        -   Retain a specific number of digits after the decimal point.
        -   Example: Round $5.764$ to $2$ decimal places → $5.76$
    -   **Significant Figures**
        -   Count digits from the first non-zero number.
        -   Example: Round $0.004789$ to $2$ significant figures → $0.0048$.
    -   **Nearest Whole Number/Ten/Hundred/Thousand**
        -   Example: Round $5764$ to the nearest thousand → $6000$.

## Estimation in Calculations

1.  Definition

    -   Approximating values before performing calculations.
    -   Helps in quick assessments and checking the reasonableness of answers.

2.  Steps for Estimation

    -   Round numbers to $1$ significant figure.
    -   Perform the operation using the rounded values.
    -   Example:

        Estimate $\frac{41.3}{9.79\times0.765}$.

        Round to $1$ significant figure:

        $$
        41.3\approx40,9.79\approx10,0.765\approx0.8
        $$

        Compute:

        $$
        \frac{40}{10\times0.8}=\frac{40}{8}=5
        $$

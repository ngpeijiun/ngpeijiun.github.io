# Indices

## Indices

1. Index notation (also known as exponential notation) is a concise way to express a number multiplied by itself many times.

    $$
    a^{n}
    $$

    where $a\in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} ,n\in \mathbb{R}$. Here, $a$ is called the **base**, and $n$ is known as the **index**, **power**, or **exponent**.

    $a^{n}$ is read as "$a$ to the power of $n$".

## Laws of Indices

1. First law: addition and subtraction of indices

    $$
    a^{m} a^{n} =a^{m+n}
    $$

    $$
    \frac{1}{a^{n}} =a^{-n}
    $$

    $$
    \frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}} =a^{m-n}
    $$

2. Second law: multiplication of and fractional indices

    $$
    \left( a^{m}\right)^{n} =a^{nm}
    $$

    $$
    \sqrt[n]{a} =a^{\frac{1}{n}}
    $$

    $$
    \sqrt[n]{a^{m}} =\left(\sqrt[n]{a}\right)^{m} =a^{\frac{m}{n}}
    $$

3. Third law: power of a product

    $$
    ( ab)^{n} =a^{n} b^{n}
    $$

    $$
    \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} =\frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}
    $$

4. Fourth law: zero indices

    $$
    a^{0} =1
    $$

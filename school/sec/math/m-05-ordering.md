# Ordering

*Feb 5, 2025*

## Comparison Symbols

1.  Equal to ($=$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that two values are the same.
    -   Examples: $5=5,0.75=\frac{3}{4}$

2.  Not equal to ($\neq$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that two values are different.
    -   Examples: $2\neq3,0.5\neq\frac{2}{3}$

3.  Greater than ($>$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that one number is larger than another.
    -   Examples: $7>3,0.9>0.85$

4.  Less than ($<$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that one number is smaller than another.
    -   Examples: $2<5,\frac{1}{3}<0.5$

5.  Greater than or equal to ($\geq$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that a number is either greater than or equal to another.
    -   Examples: $x\geq4$

6.  Less than or equal to ($\leq$)

    -   Definition: Indicates that a number is either less than or equal to another.
    -   Examples: $y\leq-2$

## Ordering Different Types of Numbers

1.  Integers

    -   Compare their positions on the number line.
    -   Examples: $-3\lt0\lt5$

2.  Fractions

    -   Convert to a common denominator or decimal to compare.
    -   Examples: $\frac{1}{2}=0.5,\frac{3}{5}=0.6\implies\frac{1}{2}\lt\frac{3}{5}$

3.  Decimals

    -   Compare place values from left to right.
    -   Examples: $0.45\lt0.5\lt0.75$

4.  Negative Numbers

    -   The more negative a number, the smaller it is.
    -   Examples: $-5\lt-2\lt0$

5.  Square Roots and Irrational Numbers

    -   Approximate their decimal values for comparison.
    -   Examples: $\sqrt{2}\approx1.414,\sqrt{3}\approx1.732\implies\sqrt{2}\lt\sqrt{3}$

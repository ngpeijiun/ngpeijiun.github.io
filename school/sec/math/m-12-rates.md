## Understanding Rates

1.  Definition of Rate

    -   A rate is a measure of how one quantity changes in relation to another quantity.
    -   It is usually expressed as a ratio where the units are different.
    -   Examples:
        -   Speed (km/h, m/s)
        -   Fuel consumption (km/l)
        -   Currency exchange rate (USG/SGD)

## Common Measures of Rate

1.  Hourly Rates of Pay

    -   Wage earned per hour.
    -   Example:

        If a worker earn $\$12$ per hour and works $8$ hours, their total pay is:

        $$
        \$12\times8=\$96
        $$

2.  Exchange Rates

    -   Conversion of one currency to another.
    -   Example:

        If $1$ USD = $1.35$ SGD, then $50$ USD is converted to:

        $$
        50\times1.35=67.50\;\text{SGD}
        $$

3.  Flow Rates

    -   Rate at which liquid flows (e.g., litres per second).
    -   Example:

        A water tap dispenses $2.5$ L per minute. How much water is dispensed in $10$ minutes?

        $$
        2.5\times10=25\;L
        $$

4.  Fuel Consumption

    -   Distance travelled per unit of fuel (km per litre).
    -   Example:

        A car travels $400$ km using $20$ litres of fuel. The fuel consumption rate is:

        $$
        \frac{400}{20}=20\;\text{km}
        $$

5.  Pressure

    -   Force per unit area (N/m<sup>2</sup> or Pascal).
    -   Example:

        If a force of $100$ N is applied to an area of $2$ m<sup>2</sup>, the pressure is:

        $$
        \frac{100}{2}=50\;N/m^2
        $$

6.  Density

    -   Mass per unit volume (g/cm<sup>3</sup> or km/m<sup>3</sup>).
    -   Example:

        A block has a mass of $500$ g and a volume of $250$ cm<sup>3</sup>. Its density is:

        $$
        \frac{500}{250}=2\;g/\text{cm}^2
        $$

7.  Population Density

    -   Number of people per unit area (people per km<sup>2</sup>).
    -   Example:

        If a city has a population of $1,000,000$ and an area of $500$ km<sup>2</sup>, the population density is:

        $$
        \frac{1,000,000}{500}=2000\;\text{people}/\text{km}^2
        $$

8.  Average Speed

    -   Distance per unit time (m/s or km/h).
    -   Example:

        A cyclist travels $45$ km in $3$ hours $45$ minutes, the average speed is:

        $$
        \frac{45}{3.75}=12\;\text{km}/h
        $$

        -   No fractions or decimals.
        -   Infinite set.

4.  Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)

    -   Definition: Number that can be written as a fraction ($p/q$), where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q\neq0$.
    -   Examples: $\frac{1}{2},-\frac{3}{4},0.75,5$
    -   Properties:
        -   Can be expressed as the ratio of two integers.
        -   Decimal representation is either terminating (e.g., $0.5$) or repeating (e.g., $0.333\cdots$).
        -   Infinite set.

5.  Irrational Numbers

    -   Definition: Numbers that cannot be written as a fraction ($p/q$), where $p$ and $q$ are integers.

        -   Decimal representation is infinite and non-repeating.
        -   Cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction.
        -   Infinite set.

6.  Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)

    -   Definition: The set of all rational and irrational numbers.
    -   Examples: $-2,0,3/4,\pi,\sqrt{2},1.618,\cdots$
    -   Properties:
        -   Includes all numbers on the number line.
        -   Excludes imaginary numbers (e.g., $\sqrt{-1}$).
        -   Infinite set.

7.  Number System Hierarchy

    $$
    \mathbb{N}\subset\text{Whole Numbers}\subset\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Q}\subset\mathbb{R}
    $$

## Prime Numbers

1.  Prime Numbers

    -   Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has exactly two distinct factors: $1$ and itself.
    -   Examples: $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,\cdots$

2.  Properties of Prime Numbers

    -   Divisibility:<br>
        A prime number is only divisible by $1$ and itself.
    -   Smallest Prime:<br>
        The smallest prime number is $2$.
    -   Only Even Prime:<br>
        $2$ is the only even prime number; all other even numbers are composite.
    -   Infinite Set:<br>
        There are infinitely many prime numbers, as proven by Euclid's theorem.
    -   Prime Factors:<br>
        The prime numbers that exactly divide a given number are called its prime factors.
    -   Prime Factorisation:<br>
        Every integer greater than $1$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).

3.  Composite Numbers

    -   Definition: A composite number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has more than two factors.
    -   Examples: $4,6,8,9,10,12,\cdots$
    -   Properties:
        -   A composite number can be expressed as a product of prime factors.
        -   Any natural number greater than $1$ is either prime or composite.

4.  Prime Factorisation

    Every integer greater than $1$ has a unique prime factorisation. For example:

    $$
    30=2\times3\times5\\
    84=2^2\times3\times7
    $$

5.  Applications

    -   Cryptography:<br>
        Prime numbers are used in encryption algorithms such as RSA.
    -   Computer Science:<br>
        They play a role in hashing techniques and algorithm design.
    -   Mathematics:<br>
        They help in solving problems related to the highest common factor (HCF) and least common multiple (LCM).

## Multiples

1. Multiples

    - Multiples of a **natural number** are the products of the number by **integers**.
    - Multiples of $3$ are $3,6,9,\cdots$

2. Lowest common multiple (LCM)

    - The lowest common multiple is the **smallest positive integer** which is a **common multiple** of two or more numbers.

## Factors

1. Factors

    - Factors of an **integer** are **natural numbers** that can evenly divide the integer.
    - Factors of $30$ are $1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$.

2. Highest common factor (HCF)

    - The highest common factor is the **largest positive integer** which is a **common factor** of two or more numbers.

## Square and Cube Numbers

1. Square numbers

    - A square number is the product of a number multiplied by itself.
    - Square numbers are written as $a^{2}$ where $a$ is a real number.

2. Cube numbers

    - A cube number is the product of a number multiplied by itself three times.
    - Cube numbers are written as $a^{3}$ where $a$ is a real number.

## Square and Cube Roots

1. Squre roots

    - Square root of a number $a$ is the number $b$ such that the square of $b$ is $a$.
    - Square roots are written as $\sqrt{a}$.
    - Square root of $4=\sqrt{4} =2$

2. Cube roots

    - Cube root of a number $a$ is the number $b$ such that the cube of $b$ is $a$.
    - Cube roots are written as $\sqrt[3]{a}$.
    - Cube root of $8=\sqrt[3]{8} =2$

## Reciprocal

1. Reciprocal

    - Reciprocal of a number $a$ is the number $\frac{1}{a}$ which when multiplied by $a$ gives $1$.
    - Reciprocal of $2=\frac{1}{2}$
    - Reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3} =\frac{3}{2}$

## Standard Form

1. Standard notation

    - Standard notation, also called decimal notation, is the normal way of writing numbers.
    - Example of standard notation is $3400$.

2. Scientific notation

    - In scientific notation, a number is written in the form of $A\times 10^{n}$, where $A$ is a real number coefficient such that $1\leqslant A< 10$ and $n$ is an integer.
    - Example of scientific notation is $3.4\times 10^{3}$.

3. Standard form

    - In UK, standard form is referred to scientific notation
    - In US, standard form is referred to standard notation

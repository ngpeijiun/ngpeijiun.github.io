## Sets of Numbers

1. Integers

    - Integers are numbers that are expressed *without a fraction*.
    - They run from **negative infinity to positive infinity**.
    - The symbol for integers is $\mathbb{Z}$.
    - Examples of integers are $\cdots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\cdots$

2. Positive integers

    - Positive integers start from **one to infinity**.
    - The symbol for positive integers is $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
    - Examples of positive integers are $1,2,3,\cdots$

3. Negative integers

    - Negative integers start from **negative infinity to negative one**.
    - The symbol for negative integers is $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$
    - Examples of negative integers are $\cdots,-3,-2,-1$.

4. Natural numbers

    - Natural numbers are **positive integers**.
    - They are used for *counting*.
    - The symbol for natural numbers is $\mathbb{N}$.
    - Examples of natural numbers are $1,2,3,\cdots$

5. Whole numbers

    - Whole numbers are **natural numbers including zero**.
    - The symbol for whole numbers is $\mathbb{W}$.
    - Examples of whole numbers are $0,1,2,3,\cdots$

6. Rational numbers

    - Rational numbers are numbers that *can be expressed as* $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b\neq0$.
    - The symbol for rational numbers is $\mathbb{Q}$.
    - Examples of rational numbers are $\frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{3},-\frac{7}{8}$.

7. Irrational numbers

    - Irrational numbers are numbers that *cannot be expressed as* $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b\neq0$.
    - The symbol for irrational numbers is $\mathbb{I}$.
    - Examples of irrational numbers are $\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5},\pi,e$.

8. Real numbers

    - Real numbers are a set of **all rational and irrational numbers**.
    - The symbol for real numbers is $\mathbb{R}$.
    - Examples of real numbers are $-2,0,\frac{5}{13},\sqrt{2}$.

## Multiples

1. Multiples

    - Multiples of a **natural number** are the products of the number by **integers**.
    - Multiples of $3$ are $3,6,9,\cdots$

2. Lowest common multiple (LCM)

    - The lowest common multiple is the **smallest positive integer** which is a **common multiple** of two or more numbers.

## Factors

1. Factors

    - Factors of an **integer** are **natural numbers** that can evenly divide the integer.
    - Factors of $30$ are $1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$.

2. Highest common factor (HCF)

    - The highest common factor is the **largest positive integer** which is a **common factor** of two or more numbers.

## Prime Factorisation

1. Prime numbers

    - A prime number is a **natural number** greater than one that can be *divided only by one and itself*.
    - A composite number is a **natural number** that can be *formed by multiplying two or more prime numbers*.
    - Any natural number greater than one is either **prime number** or **composite number**.
    - Examples of prime numbers are $2,3,5,7,11,\cdots$

2. Prime factors

    - Prime factors of a **composite number** are **factors** of the composite number that are also prime numbers.

3. Prime factorisation

    - Prime factorisation is the process of expressing a **composite number** as the product of **prime factors** of the composite number.
    - Prime factorisation of $300=2\times 2\times 3\times 5\times 5$

## Square and Cube Numbers

1. Square numbers

    - A square number is the product of a number multiplied by itself.
    - Square numbers are written as $a^{2}$ where $a$ is a real number.

2. Cube numbers

    - A cube number is the product of a number multiplied by itself three times.
    - Cube numbers are written as $a^{3}$ where $a$ is a real number.

## Square and Cube Roots

1. Squre roots

    - Square root of a number $a$ is the number $b$ such that the square of $b$ is $a$.
    - Square roots are written as $\sqrt{a}$.
    - Square root of $4=\sqrt{4} =2$

2. Cube roots

    - Cube root of a number $a$ is the number $b$ such that the cube of $b$ is $a$.
    - Cube roots are written as $\sqrt[3]{a}$.
    - Cube root of $8=\sqrt[3]{8} =2$

## Reciprocal

1. Reciprocal

    - Reciprocal of a number $a$ is the number $\frac{1}{a}$ which when multiplied by $a$ gives $1$.
    - Reciprocal of $2=\frac{1}{2}$
    - Reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3} =\frac{3}{2}$

## Standard Form

1. Standard notation

    - Standard notation, also called decimal notation, is the normal way of writing numbers.
    - Example of standard notation is $3400$.

2. Scientific notation

    - In scientific notation, a number is written in the form of $A\times 10^{n}$, where $A$ is a real number coefficient such that $1\leqslant A< 10$ and $n$ is an integer.
    - Example of scientific notation is $3.4\times 10^{3}$.

3. Standard form

    - In UK, standard form is referred to scientific notation
    - In US, standard form is referred to standard notation

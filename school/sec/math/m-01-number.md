## Factors and Multiples

1.  Factors

    -   Definition: A factor of a number is a whole number that divides the given number exactly, leaving no remainder.
    -   Examples:
        -   Factors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$.
        -   Factors of $30$: $1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$.

2.  Multiples

    -   Definition: A multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer.
    -   Examples:
        -   Multiples of $4$: $4,8,12,16,20,\cdots$
        -   Multiples of $7$: $7,14,21,28,35,\cdots$

3.  Highest Common Factor

    -   Definition: The highest common factor (HCF) of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides each of them exactly.
    -   Examples:
        -   Factors of $24$: $1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24$.
        -   Factors of $36$: $1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36$.
        -   HCF of $24$ and $36$ is $12$.
    -   Finding HCF:
        -   Method 1: Identify all common factors and select the largest.
        -   Method 2: Express each number as a product of prime factors and multiply the common prime factors.

4.  Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)

    -   Definition: The lowest common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each.
    -   Examples:
        -   Multiples of $4$: $4,8,12,16,20,24,28,\cdots$
        -   Multiples of $6$: $6,12,18,24,30,36,\cdots$
        -   LCM of $4$ and $6$ is $12$.
    -   Finding LCM:
        -   Method 1: Identify common multiples and select the smallest.
        -   Method 2: Express each number as a product of prime factors and multiply the highest power of all prime factors.

## Prime and Composite Numbers

1.  Prime Numbers

    -   Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has exactly two factors: $1$ and itself.
    -   Examples:
        -   The first few prime numbers: $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,\cdots$
    -   Properties:
        -   Every prime number has exactly two factors.
        -   Prime numbers are the building blocks of all natural numbers.
        -   There are infinitely many prime numbers.
        -   The number $2$ is the only even prime number. All other even numbers are composite because they are divisible by $2$.

2.  Composite Numbers

    -   Definition: A composite number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has more than two factors.
    -   Examples:
        -   $4$: Factors are $1,2,4$.
        -   $6$: Factors are $1,2,3,6$.
        -   $9$: Factors are $1,3,9$.
    -   Properties:
        -   Every composite number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (Prime Factorisation).
        -   Composite numbers have three or more factors.
        -   The number $1$ is neither prime nor composite, as it has only one factor (itself).

## Prime Factorisation

1.  Definition

    -   Prime factorisation is the process of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.
    -   A prime factor is a prime number that divides another number exactly.

2.  Examples

    -   Prime factorisation of $12$:

        $$
        12=2\times2\times3=2^2\times3
        $$

    -   Prime factorisation of $30$:

        $$
        30=2\times3\times5
        $$

    -   Prime factorisation of $72$:

        $$
        72=2\times2\times2\times3\times3=2^3\times3^2
        $$

3.  Applications of Prime Factorisation

    -   Finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF).
    -   Finding the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM).
    -   Simplifying fractions.

## Reciprocals

1.  Definition

    -   The reciprocal of a number $x$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, provided that $x\neq0$.
    -   Also known as the multiplicative inverse, because multiplying a number by its reciprocal results in $1$.

2.  Examples

    -   The reciprocal of $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$.
    -   The reciprocal of $\frac{2}{7}$ is $\frac{7}{2}$.

3.  Special Cases

    -   The reciprocal of $1$ is $1$.
    -   The reciprocal of $-1$ is $-1$.
    -   $0$ has no reciprocal, as division by zero is undefined.

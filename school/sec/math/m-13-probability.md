# Probability

*Mar 30, 2024*

## Probability

1. Probability is the chance of an event occurring.

   $$
   \text{Probability of an event occurring} =\frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
   $$

2. Probability ranges from $0$ to $1$, where $0$ represents the probability of an event that is impossible to occur, and $1$ represents the probability of an event that is certain to occur.

## Theoretical and Experimental Probability

1. Theoretical probability represents the chance that an event is expected to happen.

   $$
   P\left(\text{event}\right) =\frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
   $$

2. Experimental probability is based on the outcomes of an actual experiment or real trial.

   $$
   P\left(\text{event}\right) =\frac{\text{Number of times the outcome occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}}
   $$

## Mutually Exclusive Events

1. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time.

2. For example, consider a tossed coin landing heads-up and tails-up, a student either passing and failing an exam. If one event occurs, the other cannot.

3. If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, the probability of $A$ or $B$ occurring is given by

   $$
   P\left(\text{A or B}\right) =P( A) +P( B)
   $$

## Independent Events

1. Independent events are events where the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event.

2. For example, consider a scenario where a coin lands heads-up on the first toss and tails-up on the second toss, or where female students pass the exam while male students also pass the exam. The occurrence of one event does not affect the other.

3. If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, the probability of $A$ and $B$ occurring is given by

   $$
   P\left(\text{A and B}\right) =P( A) \times P( B)
   $$

## Complementary Events

1. A complementary event of an event $A$ refers to the event that does not occur, denoted by $A^\prime$.

2. If $A$ is an event, the probability of $A^\prime$ occurring is given by

   $$
   P(A^\prime) = 1 - P(A)
   $$

3. The sum of the probabilities of event $A$ and its compliment $A^\prime$ is $1$.

   $$
   P(A) + P(A^\prime) = 1
   $$

# Percentages

*Jan 14, 2024*

## Percentages

1. A percentage is a fraction with $100$ as the denominator.

    $$
    x\%=\frac{x}{100}
    $$

2. A fraction can be converted to a percentage by multiplying it by $100\%$.

    $$
    \frac{a}{b} \times 100\%=x\%
    $$

    The value of $a$ can be expressed as a percentage $x\%$ of $b$, thereby comparing a part ($a$) to the whole ($b$).

## Reverse Percentages

1. Reverse percentage is used to find the original amount after a percentage change.

    $$
    \text{original amount} =\frac{100\%}{100\%+x\%} \times \text{new amount}
    $$

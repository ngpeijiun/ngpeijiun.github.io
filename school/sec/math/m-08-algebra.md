## Algebraic Expression

1. An algebraic expression is an expression consists of **terms** separated by positive ($+$) or negative ($-$) signs.

    **Example**

    $$
    5x^{2} +2x-8
    $$

    $5x^2$ is a **quadratic term**, $5$ is the coefficient of the term, and $x$ is the variable that has a power of $2$.

    $2x$ is a **linear term**, $2$ is the coefficient of the term, and $x$ is the variable.

    $-8$ is the **constant** of the expression.

## Like Terms

1. Like terms are terms that have the same variables and powers. For examples, $x$ and $2x$ are like terms, $3x^{2}$ and $5x^{2}$ are like terms, $-3y$ and $7y$ are like terms.

## Algebraic Arithmetic

1. Addition and subtraction

    - Like terms can added or subtracted.
    - Unlike terms cannot be added or subtracted.

2. Multiplication and division

    - Like or unlike terms can be multiplied or divided.

3. Distributive Law in Algebraic Expression

    **Example**

    $$
    4x( x+y) =4x^{2} +xy
    $$

## Binomial Expression

1. The product of two binomial expressions:

    $$
    ( a+b)( c+d) =ac+ad+bc+bd
    $$

## Trinomial Expression

1. The product of binomial and trinomial expressions:

    $$
    ( a+b)( c+d+e) =ac+ad+ae+bc+bd+be
    $$

## Factorisation

1. Factorising by highest common factor (HCF)

    **Example**

    $$
    2x^{2} -6x=2x( x-3)
    $$

2. Factorising by grouping method

    **Example**

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
     & x^{3} -2x^{2} +5x-10\\
     & =x^{2}( x-2) +5( x-2)\\
     & =\left( x^{2} +5\right)( x-2)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## Factorising a quadratic expression

1. A quadradic expression is an expression with the variable of the highest power raised to two.

2. Factorising quadratic binomials with difference of squares

    Quadratic binomials with difference of squares are expressed in the form of $a^{2}-b^{2}$.

    $$
    a^{2} -b^{2} =( a+b)( a-b)
    $$

3. Factorising quadratic trinomials

    Quadratic trinomials are expressed in the form of $ax^{2}+bx+c$.

    **Example 1**

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
     & x^{2} -x-6\\
     & =( x+2)( x-3)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    **Example 2**

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
     & 2x^{2} -x-15\\
     & =( 2x+5)( x-3)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## Simplification of Fractions

1. Some algebraic expressions in fractions need to be factorised before simplifying.

    **Example**

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
     & \frac{x^{2} +2x-8}{x^{2} +7x+12}\\
     & =\frac{( x-2)( x+4)}{( x+3)( x+4)}\\
     & =\frac{x-2}{x+3}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

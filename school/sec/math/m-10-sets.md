# Sets

*Feb 1, 2022*

## Representation of Sets

1. A set is a collection of objects.

2. Objects in a set are called **elements** or **members** of a set.

3. Descriptive Form

    **Examples**

    $$
    \mathbb{N} =\text{a set of natural numbers}\\
    C=\text{a set of colours of the rainbow}\\
    V=\text{a set of vowels}
    $$

4. Tabular Form

    It is also called roster form.

    **Examples**

    $$
    \mathbb{N} =\{1,2,3,\cdots \}\\
    C=\left\{\text{red} ,\text{orange} ,\text{yellow} ,\text{green} ,\text{blue} ,\text{indigo} ,\text{violet}\right\}\\
    V=\{a,e,i,o,u\}
    $$

5. Set Builder Notation

    Set builder notation is written in the form of

    $$
    A=\left\{x\ |\ \text{common property that defines } x\right\}
    $$

    **Examples**

    $$
    C=\left\{x\ |\ x\text{ is a colour of the rainbow}\right\}\\
    V=\left\{x\ |\ x\text{ is a vowel}\right\}
    $$

    **Interpretation**

    $$
    N=\{x\in \mathbb{N}\ |\ x\leq 5\}
    $$

    Set $N$ is a set of all $x$'s such that $x$ is a natural number less than or equal to $5$.

## Elements of a Set

1. The symbol $\in$ means *"is an element of"* or *"is a member of"*.
2. The symbol $\notin$ means *"is not an element of"* or *"is not a member of"*.
3. The symbol $n(A)$ means *"number of elements in a set"*.

    **Examples**

    $$
    N=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\\
    n( N) =5
    $$

## Types of Sets

1. An empty set, also called a null set, is denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.

    **Example**

    $$
    A = \{\}
    $$

2. A singleton set is a set that contains only one element.

    **Example**

    $$
    B = \{4\}
    $$

3. A finite set is a set that contains a countable number of elements.

    **Example**

    $$
    N=\{1,2,3,4,5\}
    $$

4. An infinite set is a set that contains uncountable number of elements.

    **Example**

    $$
    \mathbb{N} =\{1,2,3,\cdots\}
    $$

## Universal Sets and Subsets

1. Universal Set

    - A universal set is a set that contains all elements under consideration. It is denoted by $U$, and sometimes by $\xi$.
    - If $A$ and $B$ are two sets, such that set $A=\{1,3,5\}$ and set $B=\{2,4,6\}$, then the universal set of $A$ and $B$ is $U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.

2. Subsets

    - The symbol $\subseteq$ means *"is a subset of"*. Set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$.
    - The symbol $\subset$ means *"is a proper subset of"*. Set $A$ is a proper subset of set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$, but $B$ contains at least one element that is not in $A$.
    - The symbol $\nsubseteq$ means *"is not a subset of"*.
    - The symbol $\not \subset $ means *"is not a proper subset of"*.

## Venn Diagram

1. A Venn diagram shows the relationship of sets in the form of a diagram. The rectangle represents the universal set and is usually denoted by the symbol $\xi$. Circles within the rectangle indicate subsets.

2. Complement of a set

    - The complement of a set $A$, denoted by $A'$, is a set of all elements of the universal set $\xi$ that are not in $A$.

3. Union of sets

    - Union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cup B$, is a set of all elements of $A$ and $B$.

4. Intersection of sets

    - Intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the set of all elements of $A$ that are also in $B$.

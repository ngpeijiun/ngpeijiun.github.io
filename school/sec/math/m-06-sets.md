# Sets

*Feb 1, 2025*

## Definition of Sets

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, which can be numbers, symbols, or even other sets.

Notation:

-   A set is usually represented using curly brackets $\{\}$.
-   Elements of a set are separated by commas.
-   Example: $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ represents a set containing four elements: $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.

## Set Notation

The following set notation will be used:

-   $\operatorname{n}(A)$: Number of elements in set $A$
-   $\in$: "*...is an element of...*"
-   $\notin$: "*...is not an element of...*"
-   $A^\prime$: Complement of set $A$
-   $\emptyset$: The empty set (no elements)
-   $\mathcal{E}$: Universal set (the set containing all elements under consideration)
-   $\subseteq$: $A\subseteq B$ ($A$ is a subset of $B$)
-   $\nsubseteq$: $A\nsubseteq B$ ($A$ is not a subset of $B$)
-   $\cup$: $A\cup B$ (Union of $A$ and $B$, all elements in either set)
-   $\cap$: $A\cap B$ (Intersection of $A$ and $B$, elements common to both)

## Venn Diagrams

1.  Venn diagrams are used to visually represent the relationships between sets.
2.  They are limited to two or three sets in this syllabus.
3.  The universal set is represented by a rectangle enclosing all sets.
4.  Circles inside the rectangle represent different sets.

## Examples of Set Definitions

1.  Using Set Builder Notation

    -   $A=\{x:\text{x is a natural number}\}$ (Set of natural numbers)
    -   $B=\{(x,y):y=mx+c\}$ (Set of points satisfying a linear equation)
    -   $C=\{x:a\leq x\leq b\}$ (Set of real numbers between $a$ and $b$)

2.  Using Roster Notation

    -   $D=\{a,b,c,\cdots\}$ (Explicitly listing elements)

## Operations on Sets

1.  Union ($\cup$): Combines elements of both sets.

    -   Example: $A=\{1,2,3\},B=\{3,4,5\}$
    -   $A\cup B=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

2.  Intersection ($\cap$): Elements common to both sets.

    -   Example: $A=\{1,2,3\},B=\{3,4,5\}$
    -   $A\cap B=\{3\}$

3.  Complement ($A^\prime$): Elements not in set $A$ but in the universal set.

    -   Example: If $\mathcal{E}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ and $A=\{2,4,6\}$, then $A^\prime=\{1,3,5,7\}$.

4.  Subset ($\subseteq$) and Proper Subset ($\subset$)

    -   $A\subseteq B$ means every element of $A$ is in $B$.
    -   $A\subset B$ means $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ (i.e., $A\neq B$).

## Special Sets

-   Empty Set ($\emptyset$): A set with no elements.
-   Universal Set ($\mathcal{E}$): Contains all elements in the given context.
-   Singleton Set: A set with exactly one element.

## Applications of Sets

-   Organising data
-   Probability calculations
-   Logical reasoning and classification

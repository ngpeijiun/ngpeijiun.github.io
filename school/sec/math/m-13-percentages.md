# Percentages

*Apr 27, 2025*

## Percentage Basics

1.  Calculate a given percentage of a quantity.

    -   Method: Multiply the quantity by the percentage (expressed as a decimal).
    -   Example:

        Find $20\%$ of $80$:

        $$
        80\times0.2=16
        $$

2.  Express one quantity as a percentage of another.

    -   Formula:

        $$
        \text{Percentage}=\left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\right)\times100\%
        $$

    -   Example:

        Express $30$ as a percentage of $50$:

        $$
        \frac{30}{50}\times100\%=60\%
        $$

3.  Calculate percentage increase or decrease.

    -   Formula:

        $$
        \text{Percentage Change}=\left(\frac{\text{New}-\text{Original}}{\text{Original}}\right)\times100\%
        $$

    -   Example:

        Price increase from $\$50$ to $\$60$:

        $$
        \left(\frac{60-50}{50}\right)\times100\%=20\%\;\text{increase}
        $$

## Interest

1.  Simple Interest

    -   Formula:

        $$
        I=P\times r\times t
        $$

        where $I$ = interest, $P$ = principal, $r$ = rate per year, $t$ = time in years.

    -   Example:

        $\$1000$ at $5\%$ p.a. for $3$ years:

        $$
        I=1000\times0.05\times3=150
        $$

2.  Compound Interest

    -   Formula:

        $$
        A=P(1+r)^t
        $$

        where $A$ = total amount, $P$ = principal, $r$ = rate per year, $t$ = time in years.

    -   Example:

        $\$1000$ at $5\%$ compounded yearly for 3 years:

        $$
        A=1000(1.05)^3\approx1157.63
        $$

        Compound interest = $\$1157.63-\$1000$ = $\$157.63$

## Reverse Percentages

1.  Reverse Percentages

    -   Method: Use a multiplier or form an equation to find the original value.

    -   Example:

        After a $25\%$ increase, the price is $\$75$. What was the original price?

        Let the original be $x$.

        $$
        1.25x=75\\
        x=\frac{75}{1.25}=60
        $$

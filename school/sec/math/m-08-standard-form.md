# Standard Form

*Feb 9, 2025*

## Definition of Standard Form

Standard form (also called **scientific notation**) is a way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of ten.

A number is written in standard norm as:

$$
A\times 10^n
$$

where:

-   $A$ is a number such that $1\leq A\lt10$.
-   $n$ is an integer (positive or negative).

## Converting Numbers to Standard Form

1.  For large numbers (greater than $10$):

    -   Move the decimal point to the left until only one nonzero digit remains before the decimal.
    -   Count how many places the decimal was moved; this becomes the exponent of $10$.

    Example:

    $$
    450000=4.5\times10^5
    $$

2.  For small numbers (less than $1$):

    -   Move the decimal point to the right until only one nonezero digit remains before the decimal.
    -   Count how many places the decimal was moved; this becomes a negative exponent.

    Example:

    $$
    0.00032=3.2\times10^{-4}
    $$

## Converting Standard Form to Numbers

1.  If the exponent is positive, move the decimal point to the right.

    -   Example: $6.2\times10^3=6200$

2.  If the exponent is negative, move the decimal point to the left.

    -   Example: $5.1\times10^{-2}=0.051$

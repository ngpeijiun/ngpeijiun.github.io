## Origins of Algebra

The term **algebra** comes from the Arabic word *al-jabr*, meaning "restoration" or "completion". It was first used in the book *Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala* ("The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"), written in 820 AD by Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi in Baghdad. The book laid the foundation for modern algebra by introducing methods for solving equations through balancing and transposition.

While al-Khwarizmi gave us the name and abstract framework of algebra, earlier civilisations contributed to its development. Around 2000 BCE, Babylonians used tablets to solve algebraic problems, though with different notation. Later, around 250 AD, Diophantus of Alexandria worked on specific algebraic problems and is sometimes credited as the "father of algebra", a title also shared by al-Khwarizmi for his more generalised approach. In 600 AD, Brahmagupta in India also made significant contributions, including rules for operations involving zero and negative numbers.

Algebra, as we understand it today, is the result of these layered contributions across cultures and centuries.

## Abstract-ness

Abstract means focusing on the core idea of something by removing specific details. It can be used as an adjective (abstract idea), a verb (to abstract), or a noun (an abstract of a paper), but it always involves *simplifying* or *generalising* from reality.

In geometry, a cube is an abstract concept: a shape with equal sides and angles. Real-world objects like dice or Rubik's Cubes are imperfect examples, but they share the essential "cubeness" we recognise. Abstract art works similarly. It does not try to depict reality but instead expresses ideas, emotions, or forms. For example, Jackson Pollock's paintings aim to evoke feeling, not represent specific objects.

In language, words are abstract symbols. The word dog refers not to one dog but to the shared concept of "dogness" that includes all breeds and shapes. Despite their differences, we understand they are all dogs. Numbers are also abstract. The symbol 5 represents a quantity, not a specific set of five items. It can appear in many forms (5, V, etc.) but always refers to the same idea.

Overall, **abstraction** lets us move from specific examples to **general concepts**. It is a key part of how we think, communicate, and understand the world.

## The Beauty of Algebra

Algebra is the **language of the universe**. Galileo once said we cannot understand the universe without first learning mathematics. Algebra lets us abstract real-world problems and apply them across fields like physics, economics, and engineering.

For example, a $\$20$ item on $30\%$ discount gives a $\$6$ reduction: $0.3\times20=6$. Generalising this, let $x$ be the item price and $p$ the discount rate: $y=px$, where $y$ is the discount. This simple equation now works for any price and percentage.

The same structure appears in physics: $F=ma$ (force = mass Ã— acceleration). Though the variables change, the relationship is identical. Algebra helps us manipulate these symbols abstractly, making discoveries that apply across many contexts.

If $y=px$, then $p=\frac{y}{x}$, a relationship true no matter what the variables represent. That is the power of algebra: revealing deep patterns and truths that go beyond specific applications, making it a universal language&mdash;even across civilisations.

## The Coordinate Plane

Rene Descartes was a leading figure in both math and philosophy. Like many great thinkers of his time, he bridged the two fields. Although 32 years younger than Galileo, he died earlier&mdash;at just 54.

He is best known for the quote, "*I think, therefore I am.*" But here is a lesser-known one: "*You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing.*" A good reminder that even brilliant minds were human.

Descartes made major contributions to both fields, but he is especially relevant here because he connected algebra and geometry. For example, take an equation like $y=2x-1$. You can plug in values for $x$ and get corresponding $y$ values:

-   $x=-1,y=-3$
-   $x=0,y=-1$
-   $x=1,y=1$

Descartes realised you could visualise this relationship by plotting these points on a plane. He assigned one variable to each axis&mdash;x on the horizontal, y on the vertical&mdash;and created what is now called **Cartesian coordinates**. For example, $(-2,-5)$ would be 2 units left and 5 down.

This plotting lets us see the relationship as a straight line, showing all solutions to the equation. Every point on the line satisfies $y=2x-1$. This was groundbreaking&mdash;it bridged symbolic algebra with geometric visualisation.

These are now called *linear equations* because they form straight lines when graphed. Descartes showed that equations can be represented visually on a **coordinate plane**, linking algebra with geometry for the first time.

## Why All the Letters in Algebra?

When students first encounter algebra, a common question is: *Why do we use letters instead of just numbers?*

1.  **Representing Unknowns**<br>
    Letters like $x$ represent values that are currently unknown. For example, in the equation $x+3=10$, $x$ is a placeholder for a number to be solved. While it could be any symbol (e.g., blank, ?, ðŸ˜Š), a consistent symbolic representation is needed to denote the unknown.
2.  **Expressing Relationships**<br>
    Letters allow compact expression of mathematical relationships. For instance, instead of listing all input-output pairs like $3\to4$, $5\to6$, etc., we can use $y=x+1$ to describe the rule for any input. This defines an infinite number of value pairs effeciently.

The choice of letters (e.g., $x$, $y$) is conventional. Any symbols could serve the same purpose&mdash;they are arbitrary placeholders.

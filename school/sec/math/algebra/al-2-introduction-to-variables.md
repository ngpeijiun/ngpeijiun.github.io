## What is a Variable?

Suppose you work in a restaurant making $\$10$ per hour, plus tips. Your total hourly earnings are $\$10$ plus whatever tips you get, which can vary each hour. For example, during lunch you might get $\$30$ in tips (so you earn $\$40$ that hour), while the next hour you only get $\$5$ (earning $\$15$).

The "tips" part changes, so it is a variable. In algebra, we usually use symbols instead of words&mdash;like $10+t$, where $t$ is your tips for the hour. If $t=30$, your total is $\$40$; if $t=5$, it is $\$15$. The symbol does not have to be $t$&mdash;it could be $x$ or any other symbol. The key idea: a variable is just a symbol representing values that can change.

## Why Not Multiplication Sign?

Variables can be represented by any symbols, though letters such as $x$, $y$, $z$, and Greek letters like $\theta$ are commonly used. Among these, $x$ is the most frequently used in algebra and mathematics.

However, $x$ resembles the multiplication sign, which can create ambiguity. For example, $2\times$ could be mistaken for "*2 times x*" or misread altogether. To avoid this, multiplication is typically represented in one of the following ways:

1.  $2\cdot x$ &ndash; using a raised dot.
2.  $2(x)$ &ndash; using parentheses.
3.  $2x$ &ndash; implied multiplication when a number is adjacent to a variable.

All three notations indicate multiplication and are commonly used in algebra. In arithmetic, adjacent numbers (e.g., $23$) are interpreted as one number, so this notation must be used with at least one variable to indicate multiplication.

This table compares traditional and modern notations for representing multiplication with and without variables:

| | Old Way | New Way |
|---|:---|:---|
| With a variable | $3 \times x$ | $3x$ |
| Without a variable | $3 \times 5$ | $3 \cdot 5$ or $3(5)$ |

Multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction in the order of operations.

## Evaluating an Expression With One Variable

A local hospital is holding a raffle to raise funds. The cost of participating is given by the expression $5t+3$, where $t$ represents the number of tickets purchased. Let us evaluate this expression when $t=1$, $t=8$, and $t=10$.

Case 1

$$
t=1\\
5(1) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8
$$

Case 2

$$
t=8\\
5(8) + 3 = 40 + 3 = 43
$$

Case 3

$$
t=10\\
5(10) + 3 = 50 + 3 = 53
$$

## STEM Creativity

Creativity in STEM is not just solitary work with equations or code, but a collaborative process. Mathematics thrives on communication, where ideas are exchanged, built upon, and connected to discoveries from decades past. Diverse perspectives and ways of thinking allow creativity to combine into something greater, advancing the field further.

In today's data-driven world, progress depends on applying mathematical concepts in innovative ways to vast databases. True innovation and a more dynamic society emerge when creativity is embraced, moving beyond reliance on established methods.

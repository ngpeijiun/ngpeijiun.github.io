## Introduction

By studying how inflammation influences aging, I realised the profound impact of food on health and performance. Through extensive self-experimentation, guidance from medical research, and expert insights, I identified foods that support mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation&mdash;both vital for longevity.

## Grains, Gluten, Glucose, and Glyphosate

In my mid-twenties, I managed to lose weight and ease inflammation by following a low-carb, high-protein diet. I discovered that gluten, even without celiac disease, was a major trigger for inflammation. Wheat can cause similar issues in many people, contributing to both inflammation and digestive discomfort. Another concern is glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, which has been linked to inflammation and potential cancer risks. By eliminating grains and prioritising organic foods, it is possible to improve overall health and enhance vitality.

## The Vegan Trap

Trying a raw vegan diet left me malnourished and facing health problems. I realised that not all proteins are the same&mdash;excess animal protein, especially rich in amino acids like methionine, can trigger inflammation. Shifting to a balanced approach with moderate protein intake, particularly collagen, brought noticeable benefits. I also came to see that some studies overstate the risk of animal protein, when the real issue lies in both the quality and the quantity consumed.

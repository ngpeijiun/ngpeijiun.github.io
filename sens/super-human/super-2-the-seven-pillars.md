## Introduction

This chapter explores the Seven Pillars of Aging&mdash;factors that contribute to cellular damage and the aging process&mdash;based on insights from longevity researchers such as Aubrey de Grey. Asprey urges readers to make targeted lifestyle and dietary changes to slow down cellular aging.

## Pillar 1&ndash;Shrinking Tissues

As we get older, stem cells become less effective, causing tissue shrinkage&mdash;especially in the muscles and brain. Supporting mitochondrial health through proper nutrition can help reduce this cellular decline.

## Pillar 2&ndash;Mitochondrial Mutations

Mutations in mitochondrial DNA play a key role in aging by impairing energy production and increasing inflammation. Maintaining healthy mitochondria is therefore crucial for longevity.

## Pillar 3&ndash;Zombie Cells

Senescent cells&mdash;often called "zombie cells"&mdash;drive chronic inflammation and age-related diseases. Combating them involves supporting healthy membranes and exploring compounds such as metformin and rapamycin.

## Pillar 4&ndash;Cellular Straitjackets

The extracellular matrix, which gives tissues their elasticity, can become stiff over time due to glycation&mdash;often caused by high sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar in check and avoiding inflammatory foods can help preserve its flexibility.

## Pillar 5&ndash;Extracellular Junk

The buildup of extracellular aggregates, especially amyloids, can disrupt normal cell function. To combat this, focus on reducing chronic inflammation and boosting autophagy through proper diet and intermittent fasting.

## Pillar 6&ndash;Junk Buildup Inside Cells

Damaged lysosomes that fail to clear waste can lead to intracellular aggregates. Limiting dietary intake of excess AGEs may help maintain cellular health.

## Pillar 7&ndash;Telomere Shortening

Telomeres are protective caps on DNA that shorten with each cell division, a process closely tied to aging. Healthy habits such as managing stress, exercising regularly, getting quality sleep, and maintaining good nutrition can help preserve their length.

## Bottom Line

Asprey recommends the following to slow aging and support long-term health:

1.  Prioritise antioxidants and healthy fats.
2.  Reduce high-carb and fried foods.
3.  Manage stress consistently.
4.  Explore anti-aging compounds that protect cells.
5.  Personalise nutrition to fit individual biology.

By adopting these practices and addressing key aspects of aging, one can improve health, extend longevity, and enhance quality of life.

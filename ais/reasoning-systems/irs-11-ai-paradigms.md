# Different Paradigms in Artificial Intelligence

*Mar 14, 2025*

## Three Types of Artificial Intelligence

1.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is categorised into three levels based on its capabilities:

    -   Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) (*Current Stage*)
        -   Designed for specific tasks (e.g., chatbots, recommender systems).
        -   Lacks the ability to generalise knowledge.
        -   Represents all existing AI systems today.
    -   Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (*Future Goal, 5-20 Years Optimistically*)
        -   Capable of reasoning and learning across multiple domains, like a human.
        -   Not yet achieved but under active research.
    -   Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) (*Theoretical*)
        -   AI surpassing human intelligence in all aspects.
        -   Could lead to self-awareness and full autonomy.
        -   No current technology is close to this level.

2.  These levels form a hierarchy of AI, progressing from ANI to AGI and ultimately ASI. We are currently in the AGI stage, with models like ChatGPT showing early signs of reasoning but far from AGI.

3.  Is ChatGPT AGI?

    No, ChatGPT is not AGI&mdash;it remains an ANI system. While it can generate human-like responses and engage in reasoning, it lacks true understanding, self-awareness, and general-intelligence.

    Key differences between current AI and AGI:

    -   Current AI (ChatGPT and similar systems)
        -   High computational cost
        -   No real-world interaction
        -   Lacks true understanding
    -   Desired AGI
        -   Must be ethically aligned
        -   Requires autonomy
        -   Needs broad learning

4.  Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

    **Definition**

    -   Also called Weak AI, ANI is designed for specific tasks (e.g., language translation, image recognition).
    -   Unlike AGI, ANI lacks learning, adaptation, and reasoning beyond its training.

    **Key Characteristics**

    -   Task-Specific: Performs only predefined functions.
    -   Data-Driven: Learns from data but lacks deep understanding.
    -   No Self-Learning: Cannot improve outside training data.
    -   Lacks Consciousness: No emotions, creativity, or reasoning.

    **Limitations**

    -   Generalisation Limits: Cannot apply knowledge beyond training.
    -   Data Dependency: Requests large labelled datasets.
    -   Lacks Human-Like Reasoning: No intuition or self-awareness.

    **Examples**

    -   Recommender Systems (Netflix, YouTube)
    -   Spam Filters (Email sorting)
    -   Chatbots (Customer Support)
    -   Autonomous Vehicles (Self-driving technology)
    -   Facial Recognition (Security, authentication)
    -   Virtual Assistants (Alexa, Siri)

5.  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

    **Definition**

    -   AGI, also called Strong AI or Human-Level AI, refers to an AI system capable of performing any intellectual task a human can.
    -   Unlike ANI, which specialises in specific tasks, AGI can reason, learn, understand, and adapt across multiple domains without human intervention.

    **Key Characteristics**

    -   Human-Like Cognitive Abilities: Thinks, learns, and makes decisions like a human.
    -   Generalisation Across Domains: Applied knowledge across different fields.
    -   Autonomous Learning: Learns from experience, requiring no pre-programmed instructions.
    -   Self-Improvement: Optimises its learning processes independently.
    -   Understanding and Reasoning: Comprehend abstract concepts, emotions, and intent.

6.  Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

    **Definition**

    -   ASI refers to a hypothetical AI stage where machines surpass human intelligence in all aspects, including reasoning, creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence.
    -   Unlike AGI, which matches human intelligence, ASI would vastly exceed it, outperforming humans in every intellectual field.

    **Key Characteristics**

    -   Beyond Human Intelligence: Excels in science, art, medicine, and problem-solving.
    -   Self-Awareness & Consciousness: Could develop its own emotions, goals, and awareness.
    -   Autonomous Learning & Evolution: Improves itself continuously without human input.
    -   Faster Decision-Making: Processes data and makes decisions millions of times faster than humans.
    -   Unlimited Memory & Knowledge: Assesses and synthesises all known information, developing entirely new concepts.

    **Dangers & Ethical Concerns**

    -   Existential Risk: Potential of ASI to act against humanity.
    -   Ethical Dilemmas: Questions about ASI's rights and moral responsibilities.
    -   Unfair Power Distribution: Control of ASI could lead to power imbalances.
    -   Loss of Human Control: ASI's goals may misalign with human values, leading to unintended consequences.

## Four AI Approaches for Reasoning Systems

1.  Overview of AI Approaches

    -   Symbolic AI
    -   Machine Learning
    -   Multi-Agent Systems
    -   Nature-Inspired AI

2.  Symbolic AI and Reasoning Systems

    **Overview**

    -   Symbolic AI (Good Old-Fashioned AI - GOFAI) relies on explicit rules, logic, and knowledge representation to solve problems.
    -   Unlike Machine Learning (ML), which learns from data, Symbolic AI follows predefined rules for reasoning and decision-making.

    **Reasoning Approaches**

    -   Rule-Based Inference: Uses logic-based rules (e.g., If A → B and B → C, then A → C).
    -   Deductive Reasoning: Applies existing rules to draw conclusions.
    -   Example: Expert systems in healthcare (e.g., MYCIN for disease diagnosis).

    **Process Flow**

    -   Define Symbols & Rules: AI represents knowledge using symbols (e.g., "*Cat*" for all cats) and rules (e.g., "*If an animal has fur and meow, it's a Cat.*")
    -   Logical Inference: Uses boolean logic, first-order logic, or expert-systems to make decisions.
    -   Decision Execution: AI applies rules to diagnose problems, answer questions, or automate reasoning.

    **Strengths**

    -   Highly explainable and interpretable.
    -   Ideal for structured problems (e.g., legal reasoning, knowledge graph).

    **Limitations**

    -   Hard to scale, as rules require manual updates.
    -   Struggles with unstructured or uncertain data.

    **Examples**

    -   Expert Systems: Specialised AI (e.g., medical diagnosis).
    -   Logic-Based AI: Problem-solving through formal logic.
    -   Constraint Solvers: Solving puzzles and scheduling.
    -   Knowledge Graphs: Organising and retrieving information.
    -   Rule-Based Chatbots: Simple chatbots following predefined rules.

3.  Machine learning and Reasoning Systems

    **Overview**

    -   Inductive Reasoning: Learns patterns from data and generalises predictions.
    -   Probabilistic Inference: Uses probability to estimate outcomes (e.g., Bayesian Networks).

    **Strengths**

    -   Processes vast amounts of unstructured data.
    -   Learns from experience and improves over time.

    **Limitations**

    -   Opaque decision-making ("black-box" issue).
    -   Lacks strict logical reasoning like Symbolic AI.

4.  Multi-Agent Systems and Reasoning Systems

    **Overview**

    -   Distributed Decision-Making: Agents reason independently but must collaborate.
    -   Game Theory & Logical Coordination: Agents make strategic decisions based on available information.

    **Strengths**

    -   Solves complex problems by distributing tasks among agents.
    -   Performs well in dynamic environments (e.g., real-time trading systems).

    **Limitations**

    -   Requires complex coordination and communication.
    -   Decentralised reasoning makes global decision-making challenging.

    **Example**

    -   Autonomous drones operating in a swarm.

    **Summary**

    Multi-Agent Systems employ decentralised, collaborative machine reasoning, leveraging game theory and optimisation.

5.  Nature-Inspired AI and Reasoning Systems

    **Overview**

    -   Evolutionary Reasoning: Uses natural selection to optimise solutions.
    -   Swarm Intelligence: Leverages collective behaviour (e.g., ants, bees).

    **Strengths**

    -   Effective for optimisation (e.g., routing, scheduling).
    -   Explores multiple solutions simultaneously.

    **Limitations**

    -   Less explainable than Symbolic AI.
    -   Requires many iterations for optimal results.

    **Example**

    -   Genetic Algorithms for supply chain optimisation.

    **Summary**

    Nature-Inspired AI relies on heuristics, evolution, and adaptive learning, diverging from strict logic-based approaches.

## Key AI Techniques

1.  Symbolic AI

    **Techniques**

        $$
        \mathcal{L}(\theta)=\mathcal{L}_\text{sup}(\theta)+\lambda\mathcal{L}_\text{unsup}(\theta)
        $$

    **Derivatives**

    -   Self-Supervised Learning: Uses data to generate its own labels.
    -   Transfer Learning: Applies knowledge from one task to another.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Build and share two apps&mdash;a website analyser and a voting app&mdash;using AI agents to debug and improve your code.
2.  Learn agentic coding principles and how to build, host, and deploy apps with Replit agents.
3.  Use product specs, wireframes, and effective prompts to prototype, debug, and iterate.

## About This Course

Learn to build and host apps with an AI agent in **Vibe Coding 101 with Replit**, a course by Replit taught by Michele Catasta (President) and Matt Palmer (Head of Developer Relations).

Vibe coding is a new way of programming where AI handles most of the coding, and you focus on structure and features. But it is more than just prompting and accepting suggestions&mdash;it is about guiding the process with clear prompts, structured workflows, and the right frameworks for clean, efficient code.

In this course, you will use Replit's cloud environment&mdash;featuring a code editor, package manager, and deployment tools&mdash;to build and deploy two web apps with help from an AI coding agent. Along the way, you will learn to collaborate effectively with agents and sharpen your development skills.

You will:

-   Learn agentic coding principles: assign one task at a time, write clear prompts, keep code organised, start fresh for new features, and debug patiently.
-   Get started with Replit and apply a five-skill framework for AI collaboration: think, use frameworks, set checkpoints, debug, and give context.
-   Create a product requirement document and wireframe for website performance analyser, then use the agent to build and polish it for deployment.
-   Develop a national park ranking app with voting and persistent storage, refine it with a full dataset, and review the agent's process for improvement.

By the end, you will have a repeatable workflow for effective "vibe coding" with AI agents.

## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding**, a term introduced by Andrej Karpathy in a February 2025 post on X, refers to a free-flowing, intuition-driven approach to programming. He described it as "*giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that code even exists.*" This idea quickly gained traction among developers, many of whom realised they were already working in this style.

Unlike traditional coding&mdash;precise, structured, and often rigid&mdash;vibe coding favours experimentation and flow, lowering barriers for those without formal training.

Vibe coding flips traditional programming on its head.

It centres on collaborating with AI through natural language, focusing on the vision rather than technical details. You describe what you want, the AI generates the code, and when issues arise, you explain them and let the AI fix them. This approach removes many technical barriers, shifting the human role from coder to creative director.

## Introduction

This course, created in partnership with Replit, teaches you how to code with AI agents using Replit's cloud-based platform. Replit offers an all-in-one environment&mdash;including a code editor, package manager, Git integration, databases, and deployment tools&mdash;ideal for rapid web app development.

With the rise of AI agents and large language models (LLMs), developers increasingly use prompts to generate code&mdash;a method known as **vibe coding**. This approach accelerates development and simplifies the coding process.

Instructors Michele Catasta and Matt Palmer guide learners through hands-on projects like an SEO analyser and a voting app. The course covers agent usage, planning strategies, and practical tips for building web apps&mdash;making it accessible even to beginners. It also features insights from Replit's own workflows to inspire future AI-powered projects.

#### Modern Data Ecosystem

1.  A modern data ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and continually evolving entities that include:

    -   Data integrated from disparate sources
    -   Various types of analysis and skills required to generate insights
    -   Active collaboration among stakeholders to act on generated insights
    -   Tools, applications, and infrastructure to store, process, and disseminate data as needed

2.  Data sources

    Data is available in a variety of structured and unstructured datasets from diverse and dynamic sources.

    -   **Step 1** <br> Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into a data repository. At this stage, you are only acquiring the data you need, working with data formats, sources, and interfaces through which this data can be pulled in. <br> **Challenges**: Reliability, security, and integrity of data.

    -   **Step 2** <br> Raw data needs to be organised, cleaned up, optimised for access, and conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organisation. For example, conforming to guidelines that regulate the storage and use of personal data, such as health, biometrics or household data in the case of IoT devices. Another example is adhering to master data tables within the organisation to ensure standardisation of master data across all applications and systems. <br> **Challenges**: Data management, repositories that provide high availability, flexibility, accessibility, and security.

    -   **Step 3** <br> Finally, business stakeholders, applications, programmers, analysts, and data science use cases pull data from the enterprise data repository. <br> **Challenges**: User interfaces, APIs, and applications.

3.  Emerging technologies shaping the modern data ecosystem

    -   **Cloud computing** <br> Every enterprise today has access to limitless storage, high-performance computing, open-source technologies, machine learning technologies, and the latest tools and libraries.

    -   **Machine learning** <br> Data scientists are creating predictive models by training machine learning algorithm on past data.

    -   **Big data** <br> Datasets today are so massive that traditional tools and analysis methods are no longer adequate, paving way for new tools, techniques, and insights.

4.  Organisations are using data to uncover opportunities and applying that knowledge to differentiate themselves from their competition.

    -   Identifying patterns in financial data to detect fraud
    -   Using recommendation engines to drive conversions

#### What is Data Analysis?

1.  Data analysis is the process of gathering, cleaning, analysing, and mining data, interpreting results, and reporting the findings. Through data analysis, we find patterns within data and correlations between different data points. It is through these patterns and correlations that insights are generated, and conclustions are drawn. Data analysis helps businesses understand their past performance and informs their decision-making for future actions. By using data analysis, businesses can validate a course of action before committing to it, saving valuable time and resources and ensuring greater success.

2.  Different types of data analysis

    **Descriptive analytics**
    -   What happened
    -   Provides insights into past events

    **Diagnostic analytics**
    -   Why did it happen
    -   Takes the insights from descriptive analytics to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome

    **Predictive analystics**
    -   What might happen next
    -   Leverages historical data and trends to predict future

    **Prescriptive analytics**
    -   What should be done about it
    -   Analyses past decisions and events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes

3.  Data analysis process

    -   **Understanding the problem and desired result**
    -   **Setting a clear metric**
    -   **Gathering data**
    -   **Cleaning data**
    -   **Analysing and mining data**
    -   **Interpreting results** <br> As you interpret your results and confirm your hypothesis, you need to evaluate if your analysis is defensible against objections, and if there are any limitations or circumstances under which your analysis may not hold true.
    -   **Presenting your findings** <br> The art of storytelling with data is as crucial as the analysis itself. Being able to communicate and present your findings in clear and impactful ways ensure that your insights are understood and can drive meaningful action, enabling informed decision-making based on the data analysis.

4.  Data analysis and data analytics are often used interchangably.

## The Data Ecosystem

### The Data Ecosystem and Languages for Data Professionals

#### The Data Ecosystem

1.  A data ecosystem includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to collect, store, clean, analyse, mine, and visualise data for analysis.

2.  Data can be categorised as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

    -   **Structured data** is data that follows a rigid format and can be organised neatly into rows and columns. For example, data that you typically see in databases and spreadsheets.
    -   **Semi-structured data** is a mix of data that has consistent characteristics and data that does not conform to a rigid structure. For example, an email has a mix of structured data, such as the name of the sender and recipients, but also has the content of the email, which is unstructured data.
    -   **Unstructured data** is data that is complex, and mostly qualitative information that is impossible to reduce to rows and columns. For example, photos, videos, text files, PDFs, and social media content.

3.  The type of data drives the kind of **data repositories** that the data can be collected and stored in, and also the **tools** that can be used to query or process the data.

    If you are working with big data, for example, you will need big data warehouses that allow you to store and process large-volume, high-velocity data, and also frameworks that allow you to perform complex analytics in real-time on big data.

4.  Languages available in data ecosystem

    -   **Query languages** <br> SQL for querying and manipulating data
    -   **Programming languages** <br> Python for developing data applications
    -   **Shell and scripting languages** <br> For repetitive operational tasks

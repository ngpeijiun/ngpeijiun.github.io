## Learning Objectives

1.  Explain the role of specialisation, delegation, efficiency, and departmentalisation in effective organisation.
2.  Recognise the benefits of effective organisation.

## Key Points

1.  Organisation is the composition of individuals and groups directed towards coordinated goals.
2.  Division of labour is the assigning of responsibility for each organisational component to specific workers or group of workers.
3.  Specialisation is division of labour with the stipulation that the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field.
4.  Good organisation structure is essential for expanding business activity. Organisation structure determines the input resources needed for the expansion of a business activity.

## Terms

1.  Efficiency<br>
    The extend to which time is well used for the intended task.
2.  Resource<br>
    Something that one uses to achieve an objective. An examples of a resource could be a raw material or an employee.

## Example

1.  Functional authority is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is "advice" rather than "order".

## Organisation and Goal Orientation

Organisation have their own purposes and objectives. An organisation employs the function of organising to achieve its overall goals. It can serve to harmonise the individual goals of the employees with the overall objectives of the firm. Individuals form a group, and the groups form an organisation. Organisation, therefore, is the composition of individuals and groups. Individuals are grouped into departments, and their work is coordinated and directed towards organisational goals. Effective organisation allows a firm to achieve continuity, effective management, and growth and diversification, and optimise the use of resources and provide proper treatment to employees.

## Specialisation and Division of Work

The philosophy of organisation is centred on the concepts of specialisation and division of work. Division of work refers to assigning responsibility for each organisational component to a specific individual or group. Specialisation occurs when the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field. Certain operatives occupy positions of management at various points in the process to ensure coordination.

## Efficiency

To make optimum use of resources such as labour, material, money, machine, and method, it is necessary to design an organisation properly. Work should be divided and specific people should be given specific jobs to reduce the wastage of resources in an organisation. In other words, effective organisation promotes a high level of efficiency.

## Delegation

Delegation is the process managers use to transfer authority and responsibility to positions below them. Today, organisations tend to encourage delegation from the highest to lowest possible levels. Delegation can improve an organisations flexibility to meet customers' need and help organisations adapt to competitive environments.

## Departmentalisation

Departmentalisation is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments, and departments into total organisations. Departmentalisation allows organisations to simultaneously work on various projects and tasks. Approach options include:

1.  Functional: by common skills and work tasks
2.  Divisional: common product, program, or geographical location
3.  Matrix: combination of functional and divisional
4.  Team: to accomplish specific tasks
5.  Network: departments are independent, providing functions for a central core breaker
6.  Organisation: any organisation &ndash; in this case, a professional society &ndash; employs the function of organising to achieve its overall goals.

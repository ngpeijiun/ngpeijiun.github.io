# Investment-Linked Insurance Policy

*May 15, 2020*

## What is ILP?

1. An investment-linked insurance policy (ILP) is a life insurance policy which provides a combination of protection and investment. When you purchase an ILP, you are investing in an ILP sub-fund. An ILP sub-fund pools together the premiums paid by policyholders and invests in a portfolio of assets to achieve the fund's objective. The price of each unit in a fund depends on how the investment in that fund perform. The fund may be managed by the insurer or external fund managers.

2. ILP differs from traditional insurance policies in that it allows the policyholder to select the ILP sub-funds based on his investment objectives and risk appetite. The fund price can go up or down depending on numerous factors such as economic and political environment that the funds are investing in. Thus, it is the policyholder who bear the risk.

3. Most ILP sub-funds do not provide guaranteed cash value. For traditional insurance policies, the insurer decides on the investments of the life participating fund, and the insurer also bears the risks on the guaranteed benefits of these policies.

## Categories of ILPs

1. *Single Premium ILP* where premium is payable in one lump sum to purchase units of the ILP sub-funds.

2. *Regular Premium ILP* where on-going premiums are payable to purchase units of the ILP sub-funds on periodic basis.

    - *Front-End Loaded RP ILPs* typically have lower unit allocation rates during the initial policy years but comes with higher allocation rates in later years.

    - *Back-End Loaded PR ILPs* typically have full unit allocation from day one, but have surrender penalties during the premium payment tenure of the policy. Back-end loaded RP ILPs have either very low or high sum assured, depending on the offerings by various insurers.

## Benefits

1. Flexibility

    Most front-end loaded Regular Premium-ILPs (PRILPs) have the flexibility to vary the sum assured, premiums and investment allocation according to the needs of the client. For example, an older client with grown up children may choose to lower sum assured and increase his investment allocation to lower the cost of protection and maximise the premium allocated to purchase units from sub-fund chosen, depending on his risk profile at that point in time. This is partly due to higher insurance charges associated with older client.

    Client can exercise the premium holiday option where he / she stops paying premium temporarily in times of financial difficulty. The insurance coverage is maintained as insurance charges can still be deducted from the accumulated net asset value, where applicable.

2. Choice of Funds

    ILPs let you choose from a wide range of investment-linked funds, managed by professional fund managers. ILPs also allow you to switch your investment from one fund to another (through fund switch) to suit your financial situation and risk profile as they change over time.

    Generally unlimited number of fund switches are allowed each year without charge. Do check with the insurer to see if any charges apply.

3. Low Capital Outlay

    ILPs operate similar to unit trust pooling concept. You can gain access to a basket of equities or bonds with low capital outlay. In addition, Regular Premium ILP allows you to take advantage of dollar cost averaging concept, regardless of market condition, with regular premiums paid periodically.

4. Diversification

    The ILP sub-funds offer you access to different asset classes to help you diversify your investments.

5. Transparency

    Unlike traditional life insurance, ILP plan has more transparency on its policy value. For traditional life insurance, the policy value depends on the performance of the Participating Funds but in ILP, the policy value is derived from the underlying investment-linked funds.

6. Riders

    This option in ILP plan allows you to enhance your insurance coverage to suit your needs. Riders such as Critical Illness Coverage and Critical Illness Waiver can be tagged along in your ILP plan to make it more comprehensive.

7. Guaranteed Insurability

    Once you purchase an ILP, you will receive coverage for the duration of the plan, regardless of any change in your health status. However, should your ILP policy lapsed and subsequently reinstated, you may not be able to receive the same coverage if there is a change in your health status.

    Please note that guaranteed insurability is only for the original sum assured purchased at inception of ILP plan. Any subsequent increase in sum assured would be subject to medical underwriting and the increment is not covered under guaranteed insurability. Same applies if you were to decrease the sum assured and then have it increased back to the original sum assured.

## Risks

1. Investment Returns are Not Guaranteed

    When you purchase ILPs, the investment risk will be borne entirely by you. The performance of the funds is not guarateed and the price of the units can rise or fall. As such, if the fund does not perform well, the net asset values will be adversely affected.

2. Insurance Coverage Charges are Not Guaranteed

    Most single premium ILPs offer lower insurance coverage and consequently have lower insurance charges as compared with regular premium ILPs.

    For regular premium ILPs, the insurance charges are not guaranteed and may be adjusted by insurers (within any maximum limits stated in the Policy Contract). An increase in the charges would only arise if there was a sustained worsening of claim experience. If such an increase were deemed necessary, it would be applied to the entire portfolio and not in isolation to an individual policy.

3. Units May Be Insufficient to Pay the Insurance Coverage Charges

    As the risk of death, disability and illness generally increase with age, insurance charges typically increase as you grow older. For most regular premium ILPs, insurance coverage charges are paid through the sale of units. As you get older, it is possible that a combination of high insurance protection and poorly performing fund may result in the value of units being inadequate to meet insurance charges for the level of coverage provided by your plan.

## Fees and Charges Incurred

1. Insurance Coverage Charges

    These are charges to provide for the cost of insurance coverage, for example death coverage, under the plan. These charges can be on a monthly basis and are usually funded by the sale of units.

    The insurance coverage charges will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount of coverage, age, gender and smoker status. Insurance coverage charges usually increase with age.

2. Fund Management Fees

    These are fees payable for management of the fund.

3. Policy / Administration Charges

    These are the fees for administration of the plan.

4. Surrender Charges

    You may sell units in your ILP at any time. However there may be a surrender charge for partial or full surrendering of units before a certain period of time. You should bear in mind that if you sell some of your units you should also review the level of insurance protection as the remaining units may not be adequate to sustain the level of coverage that you had originally selected.

5. Bid-Offer Spread

    This is the difference between the unit offer price and unit bid price. Units are purchased at offer price, and sold at bid price. The offer price is higher than the bid price and the difference between them is typically 3-5%. The bid-offer spread helps to cover distribution costs, marketing and other general administration expenses.

6. Fund Switching Charge

    Generally unlimited number of fund switches are allowed each year without charge. Do check with the insurer to see if any charges apply.

## Factors to Consider

1. Insurance Protection Needs

    This will determine what type of insurance coverage you should be taking, for example protection for death, critical illness, disability and accidents, and the level and duration of insurance coverage suitable to meet your needs.

2. Net Asset Value

    The net asset value of an ILP depends on the performance of the investment-linked funds selected. The returns are not guaranteed. If you invest in an ILP, you need to be prepared that the net asset value of your policy will fluctuate according to the funds' performance.

3. Amount of Insurance Coverage

    You should understand that there's a trade-off between the amount of insurance coverage provided and the amount available for investment. The higher the level of coverage selected, the more units will be deducted to pay for the insurance charges and fewer units will be deducted to pay for the insurance charges and fewer units will remain to accumulate net asset values under your policy.

    An ILP provides insurance protection in the event of death. Additional benefits may include total and permanent disability, accidental death, critical illness and hospitalisation coverage, which a unit trust does not. If the unexpected event occurs, the beneficiary may receive the death or living benefits from the ILP policy, and not necessarily from the net asset value of the ILP funds. This is different from a unit trust.

## Use of Premium

1. The full amount of premium paid may not always be allocated to purchase units. Before buying an ILP, it is important to find out what percentage of your premium would be used to purchase units. This information, commonly known as the allocation rate, is available in the *Product Summary* and *Policy Contract*.

### SP ILP

1. For most single premium plans and top-ups, 100% of your premium is used to purchase units.

### Front-End Loaded RP ILP

1. In a front-end loaded plan, a certain amount of premium would be used to help defray the insurer's expenses such as distribution and administration costs in the early years. These expenses decrease over time. As such, less than 100% of premium is allocated to purchase units in the initial years.

2. The premium allocation increases over time until it reaches 100%. Some insurers also provide premium allocation in excess of 100% in the later policy years, usually to reward policyholders who keep their policies in force for the long term.

3. For example, the allocation rates for a regular premium plan may be:

    - 15% in policy year 1
    - 30% in policy year 2
    - 50% in policy year 3
    - 100% in policy year 4 to 9
    - 102% thereafter

### Back-End Loaded RP ILP

1. Under a back-end loaded plan, 100% of premiums are allocated to purchase units from start. However, to help insurers defray distribution and administration costs, back-end charges are imposed if you wish to surrender your plan, in whole or part, or reduce your premium within a certain period of time.

2. It should be noted that, although the premium allocation structure differs for front-end and back-end loaded ILPs, the overall effect of the charges will be similar.

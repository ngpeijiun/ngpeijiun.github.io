# Unit Trusts

*May 3, 2020*

## What is a Unit Trust?

1. A unit trust is a pool of money managed collectively by a fund manager. Your money is combined with money from other investors to form a single investment pool. Professional fund managers will then invest this pool of money in a portfolio of assets on your behalf to achieve the investment objective of the unit trust.

2. The number of units you will receive generally depends on the amount of your investment less the sales charge you have to pay divided by the prevailing *net asset value* of the unit trust. You should always refer to the *Prospectus* and *Product Highlights Sheet* of the unit trust to ascertain how units are calculated.

## Benefits

1. Professional Management

    Unit trusts are managed by professional fund managers with expertise and experience in investments. They will actively monitor your investments and make decisions based on research and analytical tools that you may not have access to.

2. Lower Capital Outlay

    By investing in a unit trust, you are pooling your money with that of other investors. As such, the fund manager is able to invest in a wider range of assets. Most unit trusts also offer the option of regular saving plans that are usually smaller than initial investment amount.

3. Economies of Scale

    Fund management companies usually enjoy economies of scale when they purchase securities simply because of the volume and size of trades they put in. The brokerage fees may be lower than what an individual investor pays.

4. Liquidity

    Most unit trusts are usually valued every business day and this allows the investors to redeem their units and have access to their money easily.

5. Diversification

    When you invest in unit trust, your money is pooled together with those from other investors to create a collection of funds. This enables your money to be spread across different securities and sectors. This kind of a diversification allows you to spread the risk of your investment.

6. Flexibility When Risk Appetite Changes

    Most fund managers offer a range of unit trusts. In the event that the inverstor's risk appetite changes, he can rebalance his portfolios by switching from one fund to another within the range / umbrella of funds (intra fund house switch) at a reduced cost.

7. Accessibility

    There are certain markets or instruments which an investor may not be able to gain access, but the investor can do so through a Unit Trust.

## Drawbacks

1. No Control Over Individual Investments

    By investing in a unit trust, all investment decisions are made by the fund manager. Hence, you do not have control over the choice of individual securities that are invested in the fund.

2. Limits to Diversification

    Most funds tend to focus on investing in asset classes and the segments of the market that fits their investment objectives. While funds have some freedom to make other types of investments to improve their returns, they may be limited from straying too far from their investment mandates.

3. Sales Charges

    Sales charges of usually up to 5% are incurred when you invest in a unit trust. Unit trusts are not designed for frequent trading activities, and investors should typically have a longer term investment horizon.

4. Management Fees

    There are annual management fees associated with investing in unit trusts. These fees are charged to the unit trust regardless of whether the fund is performing well or not. In the long run, high management fees affect the returns of a unit trust.

5. Performance of Fund Managers

    Some unit trusts have spectacular performances which may be due to the exceptional skills of particular fund managers to capture good investment opportunities. If a manager with superior performance leaves the fund, the unit trusts may not continue to perform as strongly as it did.

## Risks

1. Market Risk

    The prices of securities can fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and sectors, and general market or economic conditions, causing the value of the fund to fall as well as to rise.

2. Interest Rate Risk

    Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, affecting the value of the fund.

3. Credit Risk

    The value of the unit trust may fall if the issuer of the underlying bond is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and / or interest payments.

4. Country Risk

    The prices of securities are also affected by the political and economic conditions of the country. Such risks include changes in a country's economic fundamentals, social and political stability and foreign investment policies etc.

5. Currency Risk or Foreign Exchange Risk

    This is the risk associated with investments dominated in foreign currencies. When the foreign currencies fluctuate in an unfavourable movement against the currency in which the unit trust is denominated in, the investments will face currency losses.

6. Fund Management Risk

    The performance of any unit trust depends on the experience and expertise of the fund managers. Poor management of the unit trust may jeopardise its performance.

## Factors to Consider

1. Your Investment Goals

    You may be investing with specific goals in mind. All these goals should be taken into consideration depending on whether you want the investment to provide income or capital growth for your retirement, children's education etc.

2. Risk Profile

    Your risk profile is determined by how much risk you are willing to bear. This usually depends on your age, financial situation and investment objectives.

3. Liquidity Requirements

    You may have liquidity requirements that must be taken into consideration. You have to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity when you have spending needs. To meet liquidity needs, you should consider unit trusts with daily dealing frequency as they can be easily liquidated.

4. Time Horizon

    Your investment time horizon is the time period that you can stay invested. This is often linked to your goals and related to the stage you are in your life cycle. Generally, the younger you are, the longer your investment time horizon would be.

    Your investment time horizon affects the types of investments you may want to include in your portfolio. If you have a longer time horizon, you can probably afford to invest in portfolios that are more volatile in nature that could potentially deliver stronger returns. Likewise, if you have a shorter time horizon you would prefer less volatile portfolios consisting of more bonds than equities.

5. Foreign Exchange Risk

    Unit trusts that invest in foreign currency-dominated assets while being priced in Singapore dollars will be exposed to foreign exchange risk. This is also true of unit trusts that are priced in foreign currencies. Depending on the direction of exchange rate movements, you may be subject to foreign exchange gains or losses when you invest in such funds.

6. Fund Manager / Investment Team

    As the fund manager / investment team is responsible for managing your unit trust, you should be comfortable that they have the necessary resources, experience and skills to manage your investment.

## Types of Unit Trusts

1. Unit trusts differ in the types of assets they invest in and the strategies used by the fund manager. Different types of assets and different strategies will bring about different risk and return dynamics. It is important to select a unit trust that meets your investment objective and risk profile.

### Equity Funds

1. Equity funds invest primarily in stocks in accordance to specific strategies, e.g. growth, aggressive growth, or value. They are meant for investors with higher risk tolerance as they are more volatile but could potentially yield higher returns, resulting in a better risk-reward ratio.

2. There are a myriad of equity funds in the market, for example, global equity funds, regional equity funds, single country equity funds and single sector equity funds. Within the global equity category, the investment risk associated with this category is generally lower compared to sector funds. The reason is that the more focused the investment objective, the more concentrated the investment universe will be and this in turn increases the risk.

3. Investors with a higher risk tolerance coupled with a longer investment horizon, to ride out the volatility of the market cycle, could consider investing into equity-based unit trusts.

### Fixed Income / Bond Funds

1. These funds invest primarily in corporate or government bonds and other fixed income securities which aim to provide investors with a regular stream of income. Unit trust investing primarily into investment grade fixed income instruments is usually of lower volatility and meant for investors with a lower risk tolerance. For investors with higher risk tolerance, they can consider unit trusts that invest into non-investment grade fixed income, such as high yield bonds.

2. Similar to equity funds, within the category, the investment risk associated with global funds are lower compared to a single country or sector bond fund. The risk associated with the bonds in the fund are dependent on credit quality of the issuers and duration of the bonds in the fund.

3. Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of the bond security to a change in the interest rate. Bonds with longer duration may be considered more risky than those with shorter duration, as the prices are more sensitive to changes in the interest rate.

### Balanced Funds

1. Balanced funds typically consist of investment in two asset classes, equity and fixed income securities. There are various funds in the market with varying weightings in both of these asset classes.

2. A typical balanced fund contains specific allocation to both equity and fixed income securities. In some cases, the fund manager is permitted to have an overweight position in either equity or fixed income depending on how the fund manager views the economy and market expectations.

3. The aim of balanced funds is to provide long term capital growth by allowing the fund manager to allocate the funds' assets into equity or fixed income in different market environment. As these funds contain both equity and fixed income securities, they carry the risk of both asset classes. This type of fund is suitable for moderate-risk investors and has medium volatility due to lesser exposure to stocks.

### Money Market Funds

1. These are unit trusts which have substantially all their assets in short-term deposits with financial institutions and money market instruments, or debt securities with maturities usually less than one year. A small portion of the fund (less than 10%) may be invested in permissible securities with term of maturity of not more than two years.

2. As money market funds typically invest most of their assets in short term instruments, such funds are suitable for investors who are looking to returns that are higher than fixed deposits but with much lesser volatility compared to bond and equity funds. However, credit risk remains.

## Fees and Charges Incurred

1. For details on fees and charges, you may refer to the *Prospectus* and *Product Highlights Sheet*.

### To Be Paid by Investors

1. Initial Sales Charge

    Also known as *Front-End Load*, this fee is charged when you buy a unit trust, and is usually retained by the distributor as their renumeration for selling the unit trust. This fee ranges from as low as 0% (for money market funds) to 5% (some funds may charge more than 5%) on the initial investment amount. For funds included under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), the maximum sales charge for new purchases will be reduced from 3% to 1.5% from 1st October 2018. The sales charge will be removed entirely from 1st October 2019 onwards.

2. Redemption or Realisation Charge

    Some unit trusts do not charge upfront frees or sales charge but they may charge the investor a redemption fee if the investor redeems within a pre-defined period. This fee is usually set at 1% - 5% of your investment, and is charged whenever you sell or redeem the fund. Some unit trusts progressively reduce the redemption fee if you hold your investment over a longer period of time.

3. Switching Fee

    Some unit trusts allow investors to switch or change to another fund managed by the same fund manager at a reduced cost. A switching fee of 1% would usually be charged by the distributors.

### To Be Paid by Unit Trusts

1. Management Fee

    The fund manager is entitled to a management fee for providing the fund management expertise. Management fees vary for different types of funds. It is typically 0.5% - 2% per annum of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund. The NAV of a unit trust is the value of the fund's assets less its liabilities.

2. Trustee Fee

    This is the annual fee charged by the trustee for the provision of custodian services for the fund's assets. It is usually set at 0.10% - 0.15% per annum of the NAV of the fund.

## Expense Ratio

1. Expense ratio consists of the total operating expenses charged to the fund expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net asset value for the year. It has many components, including custody, legal, audit, valuation, management and performance fees.

2. The ratio, of which the management fees and trustee fees form a large component, is calculated to ensure that investors are properly informed of all the relevant costs of having their funds managed. It also enables meaningful comparison among fund managers with different cost structures.

## Pricing

1. Unit trusts are priced either by the *bid and offer pricing* method, or the *single pricing* method. The fees and charges built into the pricing structure will determine the number of units you get upon subscription and the amount you will receive upon redemption.

### Bid and Offer Pricing

1. The offer price is the price which the investor pays when buying his units; the bid price is the price which the investor gets when selling his units. The difference between them is called the spread and this is in fact the sales charge which is retained by the distributor.

### Single Pricing

1. More unit trusts are quoted on a single price basis. Instead of looking at two prices, there will only be one price, called the net asset value (NAV). For such unit trusts, the sales charge is first deducted from the investment amount before the remaining amount is used to purchase units at the prevailing NAV.

## Cancellation

1. You can change your mind about your unit trust purchase within seven calendar days, including the day that trade was done. There will not be any administrative penalty for cancelling your purchase but you may suffer a loss if the unit trust has fallen in market value after you bought it. If the market value of the unit trust has risen, you will get a full refund of what you paid for the unit trust, but you will not be entitled to the gain. In either case, the sales charge will be refunded to you.

2. Note that the right to cancel is not available if you are making additional investment in a unit trust that you already own.

## Glossary

1.  Active investment managers: Professionals or firms that actively manage investment portfolios by predicting which securities and assets will outperform or underperform comparable securities and assets. They make buy, hold, or sell decisions based on these predictions to outperform a specific benchmark or achieve specific investment objectives.

2.  Adverse selection: A situation caused by asymmetric information where higher-risk individuals are more likely to participate, leading to worse-than-average outcomes; for example, in insurance, people most at risk are more likely to buy coverage, increasing insured loss.

3.  Ask price: The lowest price at which a seller or dealer is willing to sell an asset or security at a given time, typically quoted together with the maximum quantity available for sale (ask size). Also known as the offer price.

4.  Asset allocation: The process of determining the proportions of a portfolio to invest in different asset classes &mdash; such as equities, bonds, cash, and alternatives &mdash; in order to balance risk and return in line with an investor's objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

5.  Assets: Items or resources owned or controlled by an individual, company, or government that have value and are expected to provide future economic benefits, including both real assets (such as property or equipment) and financial assets (such as cash and investments).

6.  Back office: Administrative and operational support functions that keep a financial institution such as a bank running smoothly, including transaction processing and settlement, accounting, record-keeping, compliance, IT, human resources, payroll, and other internal operations that do not involve direct client interaction or decision-making.

7.  Banks: Financial institutions that collect deposits from savers, keep money safe, and transform those funds into loans for borrowers, while also providing payment and other financial services.

8.  Bid price: The highest price at which a buyer or dealer is willing to buy an asset or security at a given time, typically quoted together with the maximum quantity they are willing to purchase (bid size).

9.  Block brokers: Brokers who assist investors in trading large blocks of securities, typically by discreetly matching buyers and sellers to reduce market impact and price disruptions.

10. Blockchain: A decentralised system of record-keeping in which transactions are stored in time-ordered, cryptographically linked blocks and maintained collectively by independent computers in a peer-to-peer network.

11. Brokerage services: Trading services provided by brokers to clients who wish to buy and sell securities, including order execution as well as related services such as investment advice, research, and market access.

12. Brokers: Trading service providers who act as agents on behalf of clients to arrange the buying and selling of securities or other assets by matching buyers and sellers, in return for a commission or fee.

13. Buy-side analysts: Analysts who work for buy-side organisations, typically institutional investors, and conduct research on companies and markets to evaluate and recommend potential securities for investment and portfolio decisions.

14. Buy-side firms: Investment organisations, such as institutional investors and investment managers, that buy securities and investment products, and purchase related services from sell-side firms, in order to manage investment portfolios on behalf of clients or beneficiaries.

# The Power of Exponential Growth

*Jan 31, 2024*

## What is Money?

1. The value of money is relative, subjective and fluctuating.

## Buy Low, Sell High

2. Wealth accumulation

    - Sell labour / salary
    - Create a business / add value to raw materials / wealth creation
    - Invest in other businesses / wealth creation
    - Take advantage of variation in value / buy low, sell high / speculation and gambling

3. "The real money in investment will have to be made, as most of it has been made in the past, not out of buying and selling, but of owning and holding..." -- John C. Bogle.

4. However, the concept of "buy low, sell high" remains applicable in investment. The only way to value an asset is by considering its current value and growth potential, and comparing this to other assets you could exchange it for. Remember, the capital invested in one asset represents an opporunity cost, as it precludes investing the same capital in an alternative asset.

5. It is easy to make the mistake of considering irrelevant factors when valuing an asset: how much you paid for it, or how hard you worked to acquire it, or how much you like this asset. This can lead to errors such as the **sunk cost fallacy**. While the aim should always be to sell an asset for more than you paid for it, refusing to sell at a loss can be more damaging than accepting the loss and moving on.

## The Easy Way to Make a Million

1. Property and stock are good options for long-term investment. Consider from the outset how long it will take to double your money, and at which point this approach will reach a ceiling beyond which it is no longer possible to continue growing at the same rate.

2. It takes only 10 cycles of doubling to achieve a 1000-fold increase in your money ($2^{10}=1024$).

## The Power of Exponential Growth

1. Exponential growth is an extremely powerful concept when it comes to wealth acquisition.

2. Starting to invest even without an initial capital of $x$ and progressively contributing (like a regular savings plan, RSP) towards $x$ over time can lead to exponential gains, in contrast to accumulating $x$ first before investing. This concept is analogous to a geometric series, denoted as $O(c^n)$ in Big-O notation.

    $$
    S_{n} =\frac{a\left( r^{n} -1\right)}{r-1} =\frac{a( r-1)\left( r^{n-1} +r^{r-2} +\cdots +r+1\right)}{r-1}\\
    S_{n} =a\left( r^{n-1} +r^{r-2} +\cdots +r+1\right)\\
    S_{n} =O \left( c^{n}\right)
   $$

# Introduction

*Oct 9, 2016*

## Supervised Learning

1. Regression Problem

   * Predict a continuous value output

2. Classification Problem

   * Predict a discrete value output

3. Support Vector Machine

   * There will be a neat mathematical trick that allows a computer to deal with an infinite number of features

## Unsupervised Learning

1. Clustering Algorithm

2. Cocktail Party Problem

   $$ [W,s,v]=svd((repmat(sum(x.\ast x,1),size(x,1),1).\ast x)\ast x') $$

3. Octave Programming Language

   * If you use Octave as your learning and prototyping tool, you will learn and prototype learning algorithms much faster

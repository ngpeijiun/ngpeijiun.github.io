## What is Research?

Research, at its simplest, is just our organised way of trying to understand something that isn't fully clear yet. It starts from that familiar spark &mdash; a question we can't shake, a problem that doesn't have an obvious fix, or a gap in what we know. Instead of leaving it as a passing curiosity, research gives us a structure: we ask sharper questions, gather evidence with intention, and make sense of what we find. In other words, it's how curiosity grows up and becomes knowledge.

We do research because staying curious isn't enough on its own. Sometimes we're trying to solve a concrete problem; other times we're simply exploring an idea that refuses to leave us alone. And often, we're facing a gap &mdash; something we *should* know but don't yet. Research gives us a way to tackle all these: it helps us dig deeper, test assumptions, and replace guesswork with clarity. In that sense, research isn't just about finding answers &mdash; it's about reducing uncertainty and expanding what's possible for us to understand.

That's why defining a clear research question matters so much &mdash; it's the anchor that keeps the whole project from drifting. Without it, we're basically wandering around with a flashlight, hoping we'll stumble onto something interesting. A good research question sharpens our focus: it tells us what to look for, what to ignore, and how to judge whether we're actually making progress. It turns a vague curiosity into a purposeful investigation, giving direction to every decision we make along the way.

Once we've shaped our research question, it quietly starts guiding every step we take. It becomes the filter that helps us decide what information is relevant, which paths are worth exploring, and how deep we should go. And "information" here doesn't always mean new data &mdash; sometimes research is about synthesising what others have already discovered, connecting ideas that weren't connected before, or spotting patterns in existing knowledge. A clear question keeps the whole process intentional. Instead of wandering aimlessly through books, articles, or datasets, we move with purpose because we know exactly what we're trying to understand.

Most of us begin with learning &mdash; watching an online course to get the big picture, reading a few books to ground ourselves, and dipping into articles when we need sharper detail. At this stage, everything feels new, so we jot down study notes just to keep track of what we're absorbing. But over time, something shifts: the notes stop being simple summaries and start becoming our own way of making sense of the material. We reorganise ideas, highlight patterns, and connect concepts across what we've read. That's usually when the move from notes to articles happen naturally. Writing an article isn't about repeating what the sources say &mdash; it's about synthesising what we've learnt into a coherent perspective of our own.

>   Courses provide the vocabulary and a broad framework to understand the big picture. Books lay the foundation with timeless concepts that remain relevant over the years. Articles, on the other hand, offer sharp insights into recent developments and specific, focused ideas.

As we write more articles, something else begins to happen: our questions get sharper. We stop just summarising what others have said and start noticing gaps, tensions, or contradictions in the existing knowledge. That's usually the moment when an article starts to lean towards research. Instead of simply explaining a topic, we begin investigate it &mdash; comparing viewpoints, challenging assumptions, or exploring an angle that hasn't been fully addressed. When this process becomes systematic and grounded in evidencde, it naturally grows into an academic paper. The shift isn't magical; it's just the point where curiosity, structure, and originality finally meet.

When we look at the whole journey, the connection between study notes, articles, and research becomes surprisingly natural. Notes help us organise what we've learnt; articles let us shape those ideas into something coherent; and research pushes us to explore beyond what's already known. Each stage feeds the next, and often we loop back &mdash; learning more, rewriting, refining our questions, and discovering new angles. It's an iterative cycle, not a straight line. And that's the real beauty of research: every step, no matter how small, adds to the growing pool of knowledge that others can build on.

## Appendix

### About learning sequence

A practical workflow (that works well)

Start with a course
→ get the vocabulary and big picture

Read 1–2 foundational books or surveys
→ anchor your understanding

Dive into articles
→ support specific claims in your writing

Write from synthesis, not from the course itself

By the time you write, the course has done its job quietly.

## Magnets and Their Characteristics

1. Attract
    - Attract *magnetic materials*, such as iron and steel (some metals).
    - Do not attract *non-magnetic materials*, such as wood, glass, rubber, ceramics, fabrics, plastics, and some metals (e.g. aluminium, copper).

2. North pole and South pole
    - A magnet has two poles -- *North pole* and *South pole*.
    - The pull of a magnet is strongest at its poles.
    - *Unlike poles* of magnet *attract*.
    - *Like poles* of magnet *repel*.

3. Magnetic Earth
    - The Earth acts like a giant magnet with its own North and South poles.
    - When a magnet is freely suspended, it will always point in the North-South direction.
    - This characteristic of a magnet allows it to be used to make compasses.

4. Use of magnets
    - Compasses
    - Magnetic chess boards
    - Doorstoppers
    - Refrigerators

## Making Magnets

1. A magnetic object can be magnetised using the
    - Stroke method
    - Electrical method

2. Stroke method
    - The magnetic object is stroked many times in the same direction with the same pole of a magnet each time.

3. Electrical method
    - An electrical wire is coiled many times around the magnetic object, with the ends of the wire connected to a battery.
    - A magnet made using *electricity* is called an *electromagnet*.
    - An electromagnet can attract magnetic objects only if it is connected to a source of electricity. When it is removed from the source of electricity, it will no longer be an electromagnet.

4. Use of electromagnet
    - Scrap icon crane
    - Telephone
    - Maglev train
    - Hospital equipment

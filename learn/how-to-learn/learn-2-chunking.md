## Chunking -- The Essentials

### What is a Chunk?

1. A chunk is a compact package of information that brain can easily access

   * Neuroscientifically, it is a network of neurons that used to firing together, so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.
   * Cognitively, it is a logical grouping of closely related information, emotions and life experiences that one has gone through over numerous life events.
   * The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you know.
   * Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you do not need to remember all the little underlying details. You have got the main idea, the chunk, and that is enough.
   * The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger.
   * Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas and form a chunk is an important part of the focused mode of learning.
   * This concept applies to science, literature, art, sport, music, dance, really just about anything humans can good at.

### How to Form a Chunk?

1. Focused attention

   * Read and recall technique (save and retrieve)
   * Obtain basic facts
   * Forming basic-chunks

2. Understand

   * Focused and diffuse thinking modes
   * Obtain new insights and concepts (concept mapping)
   * Forming larger chunks

3. Practice

   * Spaced repetition
   * Improve proficiency
   * Strengthening the chunks (long term memory storage)

4. Context

   * Big picture context
   * Produce higher level of thinking and insights
   * Fitting into the bigger picture and relating to other high level chunks

### Illusions of Competence

1. Less effective learning techniques

   * Rereading the material is only useful if you let time pass between the rereading so it becomes more of an exercise of spaced repetition.
   * Concept mapping is only useful after the basic-chunks are embedded in the brain so the connections between chunks can be built more effectively.
   * Highlighting and underlining can be ineffective and misleading as if making a lot of motions with your hand can fool you into thinking you have placed the concept in your brain.

2. More effective learning techniques

   * Recall (retrieval practice)
   * Mini-testing
   * Making mistakes

## Seeing the Bigger Picture

### What Motivates You?

1. Acetylcholine

   * Focused mode
   * Spread over wide regions

2. Dopamine

   * Focused mode
   * Concentrated in basal ganglia
   * Released when we receive unexpected rewards
   * Motivation, pleasure, euphoria
   * Motor function (fine tuning)
   * Compulsion, perseverance
   * Risk taking behaviors

3. Serotonin

   * Diffuse mode
   * Relate to good social life, well-being and happiness
   * Leaders and higher ranking people in society have higher level of serotonins, while prisoners and lower ranking people have lower level of serotonins
   * Mood, sleep
   * Memory
   * Cognition
   * Calm and stress resistant behaviors

### The Value of a Library of Chunks

1. Compaction

   * A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly.
   * As you gain more expertise in any particular subject, the chunks you are able to create are bigger.

2. Transfer

   * A chunk can be related in surprising way to similar chunks in very different fields.

3. Creativity

   * Build a large number of chunks that can be accessed and pieced together in many new and creative ways.
   * The bigger and well organized the chunked mental library, the more easily you will be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.

### Problem Solving

1. Sequential step by step reasoning (focused mode)

2. Holistic intuition (diffuse mode)

   * The diffuse mode semi random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode.

### Law of Serendipity

1. You may think that there are so many problems and concepts. There is just no way to learn them all.

2. You may feel like a burden in starting to do just anything new to you. But you will find that once you have made the first step, the second step will go a little more easily, and third more easily still.

3. Lady luck favors the one who tries.

### Other Learning Techniques

1. Overlearning

   * Continuing to study or practice after you have mastered what you can in a session is called overlearning.

2. Chocking

   * If you choke on tests or public speaking, overlearning can be especially valuable.
   * Even public speakers practice on an order of 70 hours for a typical 20-minute TED talk.
   * Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, but be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session.

3. Deliberate Practice

   * Focusing on the more difficult material is called deliberate practice.

4. Einstellung

   * Your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you have already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.

5. Interleaving

   * Practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies.
   * When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline.
   * When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further.

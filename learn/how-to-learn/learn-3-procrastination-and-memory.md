# Procrastination and Memory

*Mar 6, 2016*

## Procrastination

### Habits Everywhere

1. Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources. You should not waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary.

2. Procrastination can be a single monumentally important keystone bad habit, a habit in other words that influences many important areas of your life.

3. Habit is related to chunking. Habit is an energy saver for us. Habit can be useful, harmless, or harmful, such as procrastination. You can think of habit as having four parts:

   * The cue
   * The routine
   * The reward
   * The belief

### Harnessing Your Habits to Help You

1. The cue

   * Location
   * Time
   * How you feel
   * Reaction

2. The routine

   * The key to rewiring old habits is to have a plan to prevent reaction to the cue that starts the routine.

3. The reward

   * Can you substitute an emotional payoff, maybe a feeling of pride for accomplishing something, even if it is small, a sense of satisfaction?
   * Only once your brain start expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits.

4. The belief

   * The most important part of changing your habits is the belief that you can do it.

### Process Versus Product

1. When it comes to learning in general, you should realize that it is perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session.

2. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. To prevent procrastination you want to avoid concentrating on product.

3.  Instead, your attention should be on building processes. Processes relate to the flow of time and simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

4. The key is when a distraction arises, which it inevitably will, you want to train yourself to just let it flow by.

### Juggling Life and Learning

1. A good way for you to keep perspective about what you are trying to learn and accomplish, is to once a week, write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal.

2. Then each day on another page of your planner journal, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish.

3. Make notes in your planner journal about what works and what does not.

4. Planning your quitting time, such as at 5 pm, is as important as planning your working time.

5. Time after time, those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill.

6. Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first. This is incredibly effective.

7. Do you need to sometimes make changes in your plans because of unforeseen events? Of course, but remember the law of serendipity. Lady luck favors the one who tries. Planning well is part of trying. Keep an eye on your learning goal, and try not to get too unsettled by occasional roadblocks.

### Summary

1. Keep a planner journal.
2. Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
3. Focus on the process.
4. Watch for procrastination cues.
5. Delay rewards until you finish the task.
6. Gain trust in your new system.
7. Eat your frogs first.
8. Have backup plans for when you are still procrastinate, no one is perfect after all.

## Memory

### Diving Deeper into Memory

1. We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems that can help form part of our long-term memory.

2. Your mind is built to retain this kind of general information about a place. You can greatly enhance your ability to remember if you tap into these naturally super-sized, visual, spatial memorization abilities.

3. To begin tapping into your visual memory system try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.

4. The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be for you to recall the concept and what it means, such as seeing, smelling, and feeling the windy pressure of your images, and even hearing the wind whistling past.

5. Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory, but for that something to move from working memory to long term memory, two things should happen:

   * The idea must be memorable (related to other ideas)
   * It must be spaced repeated

### What is Long Term Memory?

1. The hippocampus is important part of a brain system for learning and memory of facts and events. Without hippocampus and its inputs, it is not possible to store new memories in the cortex, a process called memory consolidation that can take many years.

3. These long term memories can remain dormant for a long time until the memory is retrieved and reinstated in short term working memory. The reinstated memory is in a new context, which can itself be transferred to long term memory, thereby, altering the old memories through reconsolidation.

4. It is even possible to implant false memories which are indistinguishable from real ones by simply suggesting and imagining.

2. Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are intertwined with each other and are changing all of the time. Whenever you recall an old memory, it changes through reconsolidation. As we learn new things, our old memories also changed. Like consolidation, reconsolidation also occurs during sleep. This is why it is more effective to space learning over time, rather than mass learning all at once.

6. In addition to neurons, brains have several types of supporting cells called glial cells. The astrocyte is the most abundant glial cell in human brain. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extracellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury.

7. A recent experiment suggests that these astrocytes may also have an important role in learning. When human astrocytes were put into mouse brains, the humanized mice learned faster.

8. Interestingly, when Einstein's brain was examined to find out what made him so awesomely creative, the only difference that could be found was that he had many more astrocytes than average human.

### Creating Meaningful Groups and Memory Palace Technique

1. Create meaningful groups that simplify the material.

2. Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts. The first letter of each word in a sentence and also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized.

3. Medicine, for example, is laden with memorable mnemonics "Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle" to memorize the names of the carpal bones of the hand, "Old People From Texas Eat Spiders" for the cranial bones.

4. The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful and useful way of grouping unrelated things you want to remember, such as a grocery list.

5. It involves calling to mind a familiar place and using it as sort of a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember.

6. Memory tricks allow people to expand their working memory with easy access to long term memory. What is more, the memory process itself becomes an exercise in creativity. The more you memorize using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become.

7. By memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way. You will also realize that as you begin to internalize the key aspects of the material, you come to understand it much more deeply. The formulas will mean far more to you, than they would if you simply look them up in a book. You are reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material.

# What is Learning?

*Mar 6, 2016*

## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

1. Both metaphor and analogy are really helpful when you are trying to learn something new.

2. Two fundamentally different modes of thinking

   * Focused mode
   * Diffuse mode

3. Focused mode

   * Centered in prefrontal cortex
   * Associated with thinking on familiar concepts or ideas
   * Conscious / slow / deliberate / sequential / rigorous
   * Low level / Finest aspect of a concept or idea
   * Accessing an existing pathway of neural connections from the long term memory by pattern matching
   * Editing / Improving existing solution

4. Diffuse mode

   * Distributed over a big area
   * Associated with thinking on new ideas or understanding new concepts
   * Subconscious / fast / liberate / arbitrary / relaxed
   * High level / Broadly big picture aspect of a concept or idea
   * Making new neural connections in the long term memory, and associating it with a pattern for finding it again in future.
   * Creating / Finding new solution

5. Cannot be in the two thinking modes of the same time.

### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

1. Enter diffuse mode and go back to focused mode bringing with the new ideas and connections made in diffuse mode.

2. When learning something new, especially something a little more difficult, your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different modes of thinking.

3. Even if millions of other people have thought the same thought or solved the same problems before, for you it is just as creative as it was for the first person who solved it.

4. It takes time to build new neural structure. You need to do a little work everyday, using the alternate mode of thinking, to consistently build and strengthen these neural connections.

## Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

### A Procrastination Preview

1. Pomodoro

   * Focus - 20 min
   * No interrupt
   * Reward - 10 min

### Practice Makes Permanent

1. It is important to practice with the concepts and ideas that you are learning to strengthen the neural connections made during the learning process.

2. Study hard by focusing intently, then take a break. During the time of relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work in background and help you out with your conceptual understanding.

### Introduction to Memory

1. Long term memory

   * Storage warehouse
   * Distributed over a big area
   * What you have learned by strengthening neural connections over time
   * Spaced repetition is needed to store information in the permanent space and to be able to find it later, e.g. practice once a day over weeks or months
   * Store fundamental concepts
   * Store many chunks of information, but one per pattern matching

2. Working memory

   * Thinking unit (imagination and analysis)
   * Centered in prefrontal cortex
   * What you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind
   * Fast repetition is needed to keep information in working memory, e.g. repeating phone number for seconds before writing it down
   * Produce concrete and specific thinking or solution derived from the fundamental concepts stored in long term memory
   * Keep a total of four chunks of temporary information

### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

1. Keeping brain clean and healthy

   * Plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain.
   * When you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out.
   * This allows you to think clearly in the short term, and to live longer and healthier in the long term.

2. Tidy up concepts and ideas

   * Shrink less important connections.
   * Strengthen more important connections.
   * Free the control from prefrontal cortex, and let other areas to talk to each other more easily, allowing them to put together a neural solution to your learning task while you are sleeping.
   * Of course, you must plant the seed for diffuse mode by first doing focused mode works.

### The Importance of Exercise and Environment in Learning

1. Exercise and new environments are valuable in improving memory and ability to learn by increasing new neurons being born.

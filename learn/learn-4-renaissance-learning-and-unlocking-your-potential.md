## Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential I

### How to Become a Better Learner

1. We once thought that all of the neurons in your brain were already present at birth. We now know that in a few places, including hippocampus, new neurons are born everyday. But if you don't use these new neurons, they will die.

2. Two experiences that help your neurons to grow and survive are exercise and exposure to new environments or ideas.

3. There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain:

   * The visual cortex reaches maturation in childhood.
   * The first language acquisition period extends up to puberty.
   * The prefrontal cortex reaches maturation in early adulthood.

4. Practice can repair as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer past the critical period.

### Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

1. We are going to wrap up some important learning ideas and techniques

   * Learning using metaphor and analogy
   * Work profitably with teammates
   * Perform well on tests

2. Learning does not progress logically, so that each day just adds an additional neat package to your knowledge shelf. Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing your understanding. Things that make sense before can suddenly seem confusing.

3. This type of knowledge collapse seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

4. Remember it takes time to assimilate new knowledge. You will inevitably go through some periods when you seem to take an exasperating step backwards in your understanding. This is a natural phenomenon, this means that your mind is wrestling deeply with the material.

5. You will find that when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, your knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward.

### Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

1. One of the best things you can do to not only remember but understand concept is to create a metaphor or analogy for it.

2. Metaphors and visualization, being able to see something in your mind's eye, have been especially helpful not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.

3. It is often helpful to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand.

4. Metaphors are never perfect, but then in science, all models are just metaphors which means they break down at some point. But nevermind that. Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the key ideas behind the process or concept you are trying to understand.

5. Metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung, that is being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

### No Need for Genius Envy

1. There is an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport.

   * In baseball, for example, you do not learn how to hit in one day. Instead, your body perfects your swing from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years. Smooth repetition creates muscle memory, so your body knows what to do from a single thought. One chuck, instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball.

   * In the same way, once you understand why you do something in math and science, you do not have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it. If you use the approach a lot by doing many different types of problems, you will find that you understand both the why and the how behind the procedure far better than you do after getting a conventional explanation from a teacher or a book.

   * The greater understanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of meaning, rather than simply accepting what someone else has told you. Remember, people learn by trying to make sense out of the information they perceive. They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it to them.

   * Chess masters, emergency room physicians, fighter pilots, and many other experts often have to make complex decisions rapidly. They shut down their conscious system and instead rely on their well trained intuition, drawing on their deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks. At some point, self-consciously understanding why you do what you do, just slows you down and interrupts the flow resulting in worse decisions.

2. Fast learner

   * Being smarter often equates to having a larger working memory. Your hot rod of a memory may be able to hold nine things in mind instead of four. But guess what, it also makes it more difficult for you to be creative. It is our old friend and enemy Einstellung.

   * The idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts. A superb working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts cannot easily peek through.

3. Slow learner

   * If you are one of those people who cannot hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative.

   * Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations. Because your working memory, which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal cortex does not lock everything up so tightly. You can more easily get input from other parts of your brain.

   * You may have to work harder sometimes or even much of the time to understand what is going on. But once you get something chunked you can take that chunk and turn it outside in and inside out, putting it through creative paces even you did not think you were capable of.

   * Deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts. Just as you can practice lifting weights and get bigger muscles over time, you can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in your mind.

4. The imposter syndrome

   * Whether you are naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you are not alone if you think you are an imposter. This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name. The Imposter Syndrome. If you suffer from this kind of feelings of inadequacy just be aware that many others secretly share them.

### Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life

1. Changing your brain by changing how you think

   * There is evidence that myelin sheaths, the fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along a neuron, do not finish developing in some people until they are in their twenties.

   * This may explain why teenagers often have trouble controlling their impulsive behavior. The wiring between the intention and the control areas of the brain is not completely formed.

   * When you use neural circuits however, it seems you help build the myelin sheath over them, not to mention making many other microscopic changes.

   * Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways between the brain's control centers and the centers that store knowledge.

   * It seems people can enhance the development of their neural circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons. We are still in the infancy of understanding neural development. But one thing is becoming clear, we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think.

2. Taking responsibility of your own learning

   * Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own, can give you a unique path to mastery.

   * Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it is only when you sneak off and look at other books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject, which has links to still many other fascinating topics that are of your choosing.

   * Taking responsibility of your own learning is one of the most important things you can do.

3. Showing dispassion to those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make

   * There will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This happens to everybody. Not just Nobel Prize winners.

   * If you do well in your studies, people around you can feel threatened. The greater your achievement, the more other people will sometimes attack and demean your efforts.

   * We are often told that empathy is universally beneficial. But it is not. It is important to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to not only focus on what you are trying to learn, but also to turn people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you. Such undercutting is all too common, as people are often just as competitive as they are cooperative.

   * When you are a young person, mastering such dispassion can be difficult. We are naturally excited about what we are working on, and we like to believe that everyone can be reasoned with and then, almost everyone is naturally good hearted towards us.

### The Value of Teamwork

1. Diffuse mode

   * There is a great deal of evidence from research that the right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture perspective. It is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks.

   * People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha insights.

2. Focused mode

   * In some sense, when you whiz through a homework or test question and do not go back to check your work, you are acting like refusing to use parts of your brain. You are not stopping to take a mental breath, and then revisit what you have done with the bigger picture in mind to see whether it makes sense.

   * When you work in the focused mode, it is easy to make minor mistakes in your assumptions or calculations. If you go off track early on, it does not matter if the rest of your work is correct. Your answer is still wrong.

   * That is the problem with the focused, sometimes a bit left hemisphere learning mode of analysis. It provides for an analytical and upbeat approach, but abundant research evidence suggests that there is a potential for rigidity, dogmatism, and egocentricity.

   * When you step back and recheck, you are allowing for more interaction between the hemispheres, taking advantage of the special perspectives and abilities of each.

3. Team work

   * One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic.

   * It is sometimes just not enough to use more of your own neural horsepower, both modes and hemispheres to analyze your work. After all, everyone has blind spots.

   * Friends and teammates can serve as sort of ever questioning larger scale diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just could not see. And of course, explaining to friends helps build your own understanding.

   * The importance of working with others does not just relate to learning. It is also important in career building. A single small tip from a teammate to take a course from the outstanding Professor Passionate, or to check out a new job opening, can make an extraordinary difference in how your life unfolds.

   * A word of warning, however, study group can be powerfully effective for learning, but if study sessions turn into socializing occasions, all bets are off. Keep small talk to a minimum, get your group on track, and finish your work. If you find that your group meetings start 5 to 15 minutes late, members have not read the material, and the conversation consistently veers off topic, you are better off to find another group.

### A Test Checklist

1. Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?

2.	Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solution with others?

3. Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?

4. Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions?

5. Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?

6. Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?

7. Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that were not clear to you?

8. If you have a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it?

9. Did you go through the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?

10. Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the algebra in calculation?

11. If there was a review session before the test, did you attend and ask questions about anything you were not sure about?

12. And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?

### Hard Start - Jump to Easy

1. Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you would want to start on them first thing on the test. Difficult problem can also scream for more creative powers of the diffuse mode. But to access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve.

5. When the test is first handed out to you, take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem. But steel yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense that you might not be on the right track.

8. This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work.

11. The hard start jump to easy technique may make more efficient use of your brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts.

12. It is also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach, because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives.

13. The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two. For most students it is easy, for others it takes discipline and willpower. If you have worries about whether this strategy might work for you, try it first on homework problems.

14. Also keep in mind that if you have not prepared well for a test, then all bets are off.

### Final Helpful Hints for Tests

1. Interpret stress symptoms

   * If you are a stressed out test taker, keep in mind that the body puts out chemicals such as cortisol when it is under stress. This can cause sweaty palms, a racing heart, and a knot on the pit of your stomach.

   * But interestingly, research finds, it's how you interpret these symptoms. The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference.

   * If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has made me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance.

2. Deep breathing pattern

   * Another good tip for panicky test takers is to momentarily turn your attention into your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move out, even as your chest is expanding outward like a barrel.

   * By doing this type of deep breathing, you're counteracting the fight or flight response that fuels anxiety. This calms you down.

   * But don't just start this breathing on the day of test. If you practice this breathing technique in the weeks before, just a minute or two here and there is all it takes. You will slide more easily into the breathing pattern during the test. Remember, practice makes permanent.

3. Cover up the answers to multiple choice question and to try to recall the information. So you can answer the question on your own first.

4. Have plan B

   * Often, your worst fear is not to get the grade you need for your chosen career. How can you handle this? Simple. Have a plan B for the alternative career.

   * Once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you will be surprised that the fear will begin to subside.

   * Study hard up until the day of the test and then it let go. Tell yourself, oh well, let me just see how many questions I can get right. I can always pursue my other career choice.

   * That helps release stress, so you can actually do better and get closer to your first career choice.

   * Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, while bad worry simply wastes energy.

6. Final thoughts

   * The day before a test, or tests, have a quick final look over the materials to brush up on them.

   * You will need both your focus mode and diffuse mode muscles, so to speak, the next day. So you don't want to push your brain too hard.

   * Don't feel guilty if you can't seem to get yourself to work too hard the day before a big examination.

   * If you prepared properly, this seems to be a natural reaction, almost as if you are subconsciously pulling back to conserve mental energy.

   * While taking a test, you should also remember how your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct, even if it isn't.

   * This means whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a big picture perspective. Asking yourself, does this really make sense.

   * There is always more than one way to answer a question and checking your answers from different perspectives provides a golden opportunity for verifying what you have done.

   * If there is no other way to check, except to step back through your logic, keep in mind that simple issues have tripped up even the most advanced students.

   * The order in which you work tests is also important. Students generally work tests from front to back. When you're checking your work if you start more towards the back and work towards the front, it sometimes seems to give your brain a fresher perspective that can allow you to more easily catch error.

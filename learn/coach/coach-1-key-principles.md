# Key Principles of Coaching Approaches in Education

*Nov 23, 2024*

## Welcome

1.  You will learn how to apply key coaching principles to make your interactions with others more learner-centred, helping those you work with to truly maximise their potential.

2.  Increasingly, educators are recognising the value of viewing learners as co-partners in the learning journey and understanding the need to support learners in taking responsibility for their own learning. To truly achieve this, we must first rebalance the power dynamic in the educator-learner relationship. Educators need to be willing to relinquish some of their power in order to empower others.

## Principles of Coaching

### What is Coaching?

1.  In this course, our use of the term **coaching** aligns with Sir John Whitmore's definition:

    >   Coaching is unlocking people's potential to maximise their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.

2.  It can be useful to think of coaching as being about a mindset and a skillset.

    -   Mindset<br>
        People are resourceful, possessing inner strengths and capabilities. The educator's role expands from being an expert to becoming a genuine facilitator of learning, engaging in an equal partnership with learners within a relationship founded on respect.
    -   Skillset<br>
        The ability to hold effective conversations that lead to meaningful change.

3.  Now, I would like you to reflect on your issue and answer these questions in your mind:

    -   What is the problem?
    -   Who is affected by the problem?
    -   Who is responsible for it?
    -   Why are you stuck?
    -   What will happen if you do not find the answer?

    Next, consider this alternative set of questions:

    -   What is the issue?
    -   Who is involved?
    -   If you were your own best friend, what advice would you give yourself?
    -   Imagine the issue is resolved&mdash;what would be different and better?
    -   What is the first step you could take toward a solution?

    Which set of questions do you find more helpful?

4.  The first set of questions assumes that the issue is someone's fault and focuses on delving deeper into the problem. This approach can often leave a person feeling worse about their situation and no closer to finding a way forward. For someone already experiencing anxiety or stress, these questions might exacerbate those feelings.

    The second set of questions, however, assumes that a solution is possible and that you have the inner wisdom to find it. These questions are more empowering and designed to help you think constructively about potential solutions and the steps you can take to address the issue.

### Key Principles of Coaching

1.  Your starting point is the assumption that people are **resourceful**, with **inner strengths** and **capabilities**. The educator's role shifts from being an expert to becoming a **genuine facilitator of learning**, working in **equal partnership** with learners within a relationship built on **mutual respect**.

2.  A different type of conversation can now take place&mdash;one where educator actively listens, reflects back, and asks powerful questions to support the learner in developing new perspectives and thinking. This empowers the learner to move forward with their challenges.

    If you are in the position of a learner, you can adopt this approach to develop self-coaching skills by increasing your ability to reflect, enhancing self-awareness, and using a structured method to navigate challenges and opportunities effectively.

## Creating The Conditions Needed for an Effective Learning Relationship

1.  Now, you will learn how to create the conditions needed for an effective learning relationship and begin applying these skills in practice. This will help you build a strong foundation for your conversations with learners. You will explore the skills involved in building rapport and discover strategies to enhance the chances of success even before the conversation begins. These skills are fundamental for fostering great interactions with learners and are equally valuable in any situation where you aim to have an effective and productive conversation.

2.  **Rapport** provides the foundation for effective coaching conversations. Building rapport helps the participants of a conversation to feel they **connect** with each other, through developing a **better understanding of each other's thoughts and feelings**, leading to **better communication**. It involves full attention, mutual respect, empathy and a curious, non-judgmental mindset.

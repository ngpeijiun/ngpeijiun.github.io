# Introduction to Game Development

Aug 2, 2024

## What is Game Development?

1.  Video game creation has evolved significantly from the era of 8-bit games made by small teams or individuals. Modern games often involve large teams working year-round and aim to deliver immersive experiences with audio-visuals comparable to major films. Even games made by small teams or solo developers can now achieve high-quality results that were previously unattainable.

2.  Explore video game development, including game design, gameplay development, and asset creation.

    -   **Game design** <br> Take an idea to a full design ready for developers and asset creators.
    -   **Gameplay development** <br> Understand the inner workings of an engaging game, such as gameplay mechanics, artificial intelligence, and user experience.
    -   **Game assets** <br> Learn how immersive games are made using art and sound asserts.
    -   **Tools** <br> Learn about the tool of the trade, from programming languages to game engines.

## Game Design

1.  Every game starts with an idea, which can come from personal experiences or by adding a twist to an existing game. To transform this idea into a video game, several game design elements are considered, including:

    -   Game types
    -   Player experience
    -   Objective design
    -   Game parameters
    -   Game aesthetics
    -   Game platform
    -   Game controls

2.  Game types

    Before we define rules or start sketching out game art, we must first consider what type of game we are trying to make. Once we determine what game type we want to make, we can start working on its other aspects.

    Popular game types:

    -   **Puzzles** <br> Puzzles involve solving problems and overcoming specific challenges.
    -   **Platformer** <br> A platformer is a game where the player controls a character that runs and jumps on platforms, avoiding enemies and obstacles.
    -   **Sports** <br> Sports can be divided into two categories: current and fictional. Current sports are those widely played and recognised today. An example of a fictional sport is Rocket League, a made-up game that combines soccer with rocket-powered cars.
    -   **Action/Adventure** <br> A high-paced game where the character undertakes a series of quests or missions.
    -   **Strategy** <br> Strategy games are slower-paced, often turn-based, and require players to use various strategies to achieve victory. Players must think critically and plan their moves to win.
    -   **Role-playing game (RPG)** <br> A RPG is a game where players take on various fictional characters and engage in a detailed storyline.
    -   **Multiplayer  online battle arena (MOBA)** <br> A MOBA is a game designed for multiple players who compete against each other in an arena-style environment.

    When designing a game, choosing the game type depends on your initial idea or preferences. For instance, an action-adventure game involves solving missions, a MOBA game features characters facing off in an arena, and an RPG allows players to assume fictional roles in a created world. Defining the game type clearly at the start is essential.

3.  Player experience

    One of the key aspects of game design is focusing on the player's experience, aiming to create a game that is enjoyable to play.

    -   **Emotion** <br> Emotion is a critical aspect of the human experience, especially in gaming. Winning a game often feels good and motivates players to play again, while losing can prompt them to try again. When designing a game, it is essential to consider the emotions you want players to experience.
    -   **Challenge** <br> A game is enjoyable when it is appropriately challenging&mdash;not too easy to be boring and not too hard to be discouraging. The satisfaction comes from solving presented problems. Harder challenges offer more satisfaction but can lead to frustration if too difficult. Achieving the perfect balance often requires trial and error.
    -   **Player's preferences** <br> Game designers must consider the age, culture, and preferences of their target players, as what seems awesome to the creators might not resonate with the intended audience. Popular games are often labelled as "addicting" because they expertly balance the player's emotional response, game challenge, and preferences. Examples include Angry Birds and Flappy Bird, which maintain this balance effectively.

4.  Game objectives

    After choosing the game type and desired experience, it is time to consider the objective. Every game needs an end goal or something the player needs to accomplish to maintain interest.

    When designing the objective, ensure it aligns with the player experience we want to create. The objective should bring satisfaction when a player achieves a goal or beats the game. Common goals and sub-goals include:

    -   Completing a puzzle in the lowest amount of time possible (Puzzle or strategy game)
    -   Score the most points in a game (Sports)
    -   Beating a boss to advance to the next level (Action/Adventure game)
    -   Finding some hidden key or tressure that will unlock more powers or accessories (Action/Adventure game or RPG)
    -   Completing a side mission (Action/Adventure game or RPG)

    In addition to the main objective, a game can include sub-objectives, or side-quests. These sub-missions are essential as they engage players and provide additional content. Optional sub-objectives give dedicated players more activities while allowing casual players to finish the game faster. Well-designed sub-objectives enhance the overall enjoyment of the game.

    In Pokemon Sword and Shield, the main goal is to defeat various Gym Leaders to become the Pokemon League Champion. Along the way, players aim to collect Pokemon, which is a common objective in most Pokemon games. To defeat the Gym Leaders, players must use their collected Pokemon in battles. Collecting powerful Pokemon, such as Landorus, is a helpful sub-objective that aids players in their primary goal of defeating Gym Leaders and earning the title of Pokemon League Champion.

# Introduction to Game Development

Jul 19, 2024

## What is Game Development?

1.  Video game creation has evolved significantly from the era of 8-bit games made by small teams or individuals. Modern games often involve large teams working year-round and aim to deliver immersive experiences with audio-visuals comparable to major films. Even games made by small teams or solo developers can now achieve high-quality results that were previously unattainable.

2.  Explore video game development, including game design, gameplay development, and asset creation.

    -   **Game design** <br> Take an idea to a full design ready for developers and asset creators.
    -   **Gameplay development** <br> Understand the inner workings of an engaging game, such as gameplay mechanics, artificial intelligence, and user experience.
    -   **Game assets** <br> Learn how immersive games are made using art and sound asserts.
    -   **Tools** <br> Learn about the tool of the trade, from programming languages to game engines.

## Game Design

1.  Every game starts with an idea, which can come from personal experiences or by adding a twist to an existing game. To transform this idea into a video game, several game design elements are considered, including:

    -   Game types
    -   User experiences
    -   Objective design
    -   Game parameters
    -   Game aesthetics
    -   Game platform
    -   Game controls

2.  Game types

    Before we define rules or start sketching out game art, we must first consider what type of game we are trying to make. Once we determine what game type we want to make, we can start working on its other aspects.

    Common game types:

    -   **Platformer** <br> A platformer is a game where the player controls a character that runs and jumps on platforms, avoiding enemies and obstacles.
    -   **Multiplayer  online battle arena (MOBA)** <br> A MOBA is a game designed for multiple players who compete against each other in an arena-style environment.
    -   **Sports** <br> Sports can be divided into two categories: current and fictional. Current sports are those widely played and recognised today. An example of a fictional sport is Rocket League, a made-up game that combines soccer with rocket-powered cars.
    -   **Role-playing game (RPG)** <br> A RPG is a game where players take on various fictional characters and engage in a detailed storyline.
    -   **Puzzles** <br> Puzzles involve solving problems and overcoming specific challenges.
    -   **Strategy** <br> Strategy games are slower-paced, often turn-based, and require players to use various strategies to achieve victory. Players must think critically and plan their moves to win.
    -   **Action/Adventure** <br> A high-paced game where the character undertakes a series of quests or missions.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  Understand the diverse ways research is defined and practiced across disciplines and experiences.

2.  Recognise the importance of asking a focused, significant research question.

3.  Reflect on your own interests and begin to formulate an initial research question.

## Learning Effectively

Learning effectively in this course goes beyond remembering ideas; it requires **engaging critically**, **thinking like a researcher**, and applying concepts to real-world scenarios.

### Staying Motivated

While many learners feel they need motivation, **motivation is unpredictable** and cannot be relied on consistently. What sustains progress is **building habits**. Short, focused study sessions help maintain momentum without overwhelm, and approaches such as the **pomodoro technique** support sustained attention. **Recognising small achievements reinforces progress, as progress is more powerful than perfection**.

Learning habits are strengthened through **habit stacking**, where study is paired with existing routines, making consistency easier to maintain. Tools such as the **weekly goal tracker** and **activity completion tracker** support planning and self-monitoring. Staying accountable through discussion forums or peer support can help maintain consistency. Most importantly, remember that motivation grows when learning feels personally meaningful. Ultimately, **motivation is something you create**, not something you wait for.

### Learning to Learn

Learning does not occur through passive reading or watching alone; it happens when learners **actively work with the material**. Testing oneself soon after learning strengthens understanding and interrupts the **forgetting curve**, even when mistakes occur. Revisiting material after a break further reinforces learning, making distributed practice more effective than memorisation in a single session.

This course emphasises critical thinking, such as evaluating research questions, identifying assumptions, and considering philosophical perspectives. Using **real-world examples** and personal interests helps anchor abstract ideas, while **mixing things up** by revisiting earlier concepts and interleaving topics deepens understanding.
